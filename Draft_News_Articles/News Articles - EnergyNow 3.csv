MOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) – OPEC leader Saudi Arabia dismissed calls for speedier oil output increases on Thursday, saying its efforts with allies were enough and protecting the oil market from the wild price swings seen in natural gas and coal markets.

“What we see in the oil market today is an incremental (price) increase of 29%, vis-à-vis 500% increases in (natural) gas prices, 300% increases in coal prices, 200% increases in NGLs (natural gas liquids) …,” Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told a forum in Moscow on Thursday.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, collectively known as OPEC+, have done a “remarkable” job acting as “so-called regulator of the oil market,” he said.

“Gas markets, coal markets, other sources of energy need a regulator. This situation is telling us that people need to copy and paste what OPEC+ has done and what it has achieved.”

Asked about calls by major consumers like the United States for OPEC+ to increase production further to cool off rising oil prices, Prince Abdulaziz said: “I keep telling people we are increasing production.”

He said OPEC+ would be adding 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and then again in the following months.

At its meeting earlier this month, OPEC+ stuck to its agreement of increasing production by 400,000 bpd a month as it unwinds production cuts.

“We want to make sure that we reduce those excess capacities that we have developed as a result of COVID,” he said, adding that OPEC+ wanted to do it “in a gradual, phased-in approach”.

Prince Abdulaziz said that while OECD oil inventories were on track to normalise at the end of this year, 2022 was looking “a bit of a challenging year”.

OPEC+ figures show the oil market is set for a surplus of about 1.4 million bpd next year."
[],10/14/2021,"Carrollton, Texas, Oct. 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Allied Energy Corp (OTC Pink: AGYP), an oil and gas company focused on leasing and reworking oil and gas projects in Texas, is pleased to announce that the Company is successfully producing oil at three of the wells located on the Gilmer Lease.

Throughout the month of September, Allied ground crews were focusing their efforts at the Gilmer Lease site and on wells number 1, 2, and 5, specifically. Since October 11, 2021, Allied is pleased to report that these three wells have been pumping and producing both oil and natural gas. Representatives of Allied Energy has identified a regional natural gas purchasing company and are presently working on securing a Gas Purchase Agreement.

The Annie Gilmer lease is a 300 acre site in the small community of Crystal Falls, Texas on the banks of the Clear Fork of the Brazos river, approximately thirty miles north of the town of Breckenridge, Texas. There were six wells drilled on the lease starting in the mid 70’s with the last being drilled in 1989.

CEO George Montieth commented: “I am pleased with the progress at the Gilmer Lease location. Three wells have been reworked and re-completed and are now back in production. Allied has reached an important milestone in that we have achieved initial oil production at two of our lease locations. We have two wells producing at the Green Lease and three wells producing at the Gilmer Lease.”

Allied project manager, Curtis Boyles, will be on the ground at the Prometheus Lease focusing attention on well H-1 (please see last press release). Allied is committed to consistent updates that convey our corporate progress at this exciting new lease location.

WTI crude futures were up 1.1% and trading near their highest level since 2014. Record gas prices are boosting consumption of other fuels and could add about 500,000 barrels a day of oil use over the next six months, the IEA said.

Saudi Arabia’s energy minister meanwhile reiterated the need for producers to take a gradual, phased approach to supply hikes. He said the oil market will be balanced by the end of the year, but reiterated that OPEC and its allies will face a challenging 2022.

Crude’s rally in recent months has been underscored by wider gains in energy prices. Some analysts, including at Bank of America Corp., see potential for prices to reach $100 a barrel, though RBC Capital Markets cautioned that stockpiles will need to fall by 550 million barrels between now and June for that to happen.

“Risks for the oil market are clearly skewed to the upside in the coming weeks,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV. “The global balance continues to tighten, while the potential for further gas-to-oil switching suggests an even tighter market.”

Prices: WTI for November delivery added 1% to $81.24 a barrel at 9:19 a.m. in London. On Monday, the U.S. benchmark hit $82.18, the highest since October 2014.

Brent for December settlement gained 1.1% to $84.05 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.

RBC also said that longer-dated oil prices will continue to rally. Crude is in the early days of a multiyear structurally strong cycle, the bank’s analysts including Michael Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a note.

Meanwhile the American Petroleum Institute reported a mixed set of inventory figures. Nationwide crude stockpiles grew, but those at the key hub of Cushing, Oklahoma fell sharply, as did gasoline and distillate supplies."

Brent crude rose 0.9% to $83.95 a barrel as of 9:21 a.m. in London, bringing the increase for the week to almost 2%.

The IEA raised its estimate for demand growth this year by 300,000 barrels a day to 5.5 million barrels a day, and increased it slightly for 2022 to 3.3 million barrels a day. The effect of oil-gas switching will mostly be felt this quarter and next, the agency said.

The gas crisis isn’t entirely a net positive for oil consumption. The increase in the IEA’s demand estimates was tempered by a weaker outlook for GDP resulting mainly from supply-chain issues and rising energy costs.

“The surge in prices has swept through the entire global energy chain,” the IEA said. “Higher energy prices are also adding to inflationary pressures that, along with power outages, could lead to lower industrial activity and a slowdown in the economic recovery.”

The agency noted that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies stuck to their plan to boost production by 400,000 barrels a day “despite calls from major consuming countries for a more substantial increase.”

OPEC+ showed no signs of deviating from its plan. Speaking at Russian Energy Week in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman reiterated his commitment to a gradual and phased revival of idle supply. The crisis engulfing other energy markets shows what a good job the group has done in regulating oil, he said.

Global oil production will rise by about 2.7 million barrels a day from September to the end of the year as OPEC+ continues to unwind its cuts and U.S. output recovers from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, the IEA said. Even with those additions, the market will be in a supply deficit of about 700,000 barrels a day for the rest of this year, before flipping back into surplus in early 2022, the IEA said."

“We have done a remarkable job,” he said during the Russian Energy Week conference. “Gas markets, coal markets, other sources of energy need a regulator. This situation is telling us that people need to copy and paste what OPEC has done.”

Gas futures in Asia and Europe have soared by more than 150% since the end of June, while coal’s doubled. Brent crude, by contrast, is up 12%.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia and have been under pressure from major consumers to accelerate the pace of their supply increases. The calls have become louder since the surge in gas prices caused some power producers to switch to oil.

“Unlike the gas market, the oil market is now more predictable, more understandable for market participants,” Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who handles energy policy, said on the same panel. “Today’s prices and the current balance of supply and demand reflect the current actual situation.”

The United Arab Emirates’ Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei echoed their comments and said there was no danger of the oil market overheating because of OPEC+’s stance.

“You need to trust us because we have enough experience dealing with different cycles,” he said.

Next Year’s Different

Prince Abdulaziz said he was concerned about the oil market shifting to a supply surplus in 2022 and ending the year with a “huge amount of over stocks.”

“We’ll have a challenging year,” he said. “We keep telling people we should look way beyond the tip of our noses.”

Several traders and Wall Street banks forecast that global oil demand will drop below supply around early 2022. The daily balance will change from a supply deficit of around 1.5 million barrels now to a surplus of almost 2 million by March, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co."

Europe’s largest gas supplier is ramping up deliveries in line with requests from customers and is “prepared to discuss any additional steps” to stabilize the market, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. He blamed the region’s energy crisis on flawed policies rather than a lack of supply.

Despite Putin’s assurances, European gas prices continued to rise. The Dutch front-month contract climbed as much as 10% on Thursday, exceeding 100 euros ($116) per megawatt-hour for the first time since last Friday, before edging lower to 98.50 euros at 2:46 p.m. Amsterdam time. The U.K. equivalent also rose as much as 10% earlier, before falling back to 249.54 pence a therm, about a 6% gain.

European buyers have not yet asked the Russian government to increase gas supplies, news service Tass reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.

“The market seems to consider that the renewal of the historical partnership Putin is asking for from Europeans — with a clarification on the role of gas in their energy mix — could take time to materialize to resolve the short-term problem they are facing,” Engie EnergyScan wrote in a report. European gas is also probably getting a boost from rising Asian coal prices, it said.

U.K. within-day contracts rose as much as 11.6% on fears that low wind power generation will tighten gas markets further. The U.K.’s wind power capacity is forecast to drop to 1,384 megawatts at 7 p.m. local time on Friday, its lowest level in more than four weeks. Crimped wind power generation is likely to boost Britain’s emissions and power markets as well as natural gas, consultant Inspired Energy wrote in a note.

But while next-month delivery prices are high, contracts for shipping in 2022 are trading at less than half or one-third, Harry Huang, head of gas, power and derivatives trading at PetroChina International, said at a virtual conference on Thursday. “That perfect storm will pass,” he added.

Persistently high prices are the result of surging liquefied natural gas prices last winter, Melissa Lindsay, founder and CEO of LNG brokerage Emstream, said at the same event. “People’s willingness to pay high prices right now for winter cargoes is because of what they saw last year,” she said."
[],10/14/2021,"Energy costs are rising worldwide, in some cases leading to shortages in major economies like China and India. In the United States, the average retail cost of a gallon of gas is at a seven-year high, and winter fuel costs are expected to surge, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Oil-and-gas production remains below the nation’s peak reached in 2019.

The talks with energy companies touched on several issues, including prices, according to a third person familiar with the discussions. The administration has been in discussions with the oil industry over limiting methane emissions in recent months.

“We are closely monitoring the cost of oil and the cost of gas Americans are paying at the pump. And we are using every tool at our disposal to address anti-competitive practices in U.S. and global energy markets to ensure reliable and stable energy markets,” a White House official said.

U.S. crude oil recently hit $80 a barrel for the first time in seven years, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies known as OPEC+ restrict output. The White House has discussed rising prices with top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.

The average retail price of a gallon of gasoline has risen to $3.29, according to AAA figures. The U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday that household heating costs are expected to rise dramatically this winter for all fuels, but particularly for heating oil and propane.

U.S. oil production has been slow to rebound from 2020, when output dropped during the coronavirus outbreak. Production hit a record of nearly 13 million barrels per day (bpd) in late 2019, but the U.S. Energy Department said Wednesday that output will only average 11 million bpd in 2021, rising to 11.7 million bpd in 2022.

Natural gas prices are up sharply this year, the result of supply shortages and stronger-than-expected demand in Europe and Asia.

U.S. shale producers, who are responsible for the boom in crude oil output in the last 10 years, have been less willing to drill for more oil after years of weak financial performance, and have instead focused on cutting spending to boost returns for investors.

It can take six months to drill and complete a new well and bring the oil and gas to market. Any call by the White House for an increase in U.S. production is likely to fall on deaf ears, according to one oil executive, who did not want to be identified criticizing the approach. The industry has also been unhappy with some of President Joe Biden’s earlier actions, including a temporary drilling halt on federal lands, that they see as an attack on the industry.

“By pursuing policies that restrict supply and make it harder to produce oil and natural gas here in America, Americans will have to pay more for their energy,” said Anne Bradbury, chief executive officer at the American Exploration and Production Council, which lobbies for independent oil-and-gas producers.

Biden’s administration has been conducting internal discussions about rising fuel costs, one of the two sources added.

The United States has so far been insulated from natural gas fuel shortages seen in Asia and Europe, analysts said, because of the nation’s limited ability to export liquefied natural gas. U.S. benchmark natural gas prices are currently $5.68 per million British thermal units – but prices overseas have been in the $30s.

“I don’t think the fundamentals back those supersized numbers,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

The White House has been trying to tackle supply bottlenecks that have boosted the price of various goods, from meat to semiconductors. Officials said Wednesday that the administration has been working with major ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, along with shipping giants UPS and FedEx, to alleviate congestion slowing deliveries. read more"

The government will consider selling development rights in waters along the Carolinas, California, Oregon and New York, as well as the central Atlantic and the gulfs of Maine and Mexico, potentially leaving just the U.S. Arctic coast untouched by turbines. All told, the Interior Department envisions as many as seven offshore wind lease sales by 2025.

Most of the wind leasing plans described Wednesday have previously been proposed or telegraphed, including an effort to get the first-ever wind farms floating off the California coast. But with her remarks, Haaland offered the clearest vision yet of what a new surge in offshore wind development could look like.

Two small wind farms now operate in waters off the U.S. East Coast today, but the country is still trying to catch up with China, Germany, the U.K. and other countries in generating power from the strong, steady gusts at sea.

The administration’s offshore wind plans could create “tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs, revitalize coastal communities and deliver vast amounts of reliable clean energy,” American Clean Power Association Chief Executive Heather Zichal said in a statement.

The plans could also help satisfy President Joe Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by the end of the decade.

Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is already scrutinizing plans for nine offshore wind projects in leased areas along the East Coast, with pending proposals representing as much as 19 gigawatts of potential renewable power. And the agency is working to identify new areas of the U.S. outer continental shelf for leasing — a move that responds to the clamor by renewable developers for more territory as well as their desire for a predictable outline of what tracts could become available.

“We are working to facilitate a pipeline of projects that will establish confidence for the offshore wind industry,” Bureau Director Amanda Lefton said in a statement. “At the same time, we want to reduce potential conflicts as much as we can.”

The issue is critical. Some environmentalists and fishing interests have raised concerns with the administration’s plans and the pace of offshore wind development. And successful litigation over project approvals could chill investment plans. The Responsible Offshore Development Alliance has already challenged the Biden administration’s approval of the $2.8 billion Vineyard Wind LLC project, the first major commercial-scale wind farm to be permitted in federal waters.

National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said the additional clarity will aid developers. “Providing a reliable and predictable road map of offshore wind opportunities will help boost critical investments into the supply chain, ports and workers,” he said by email.

The Interior Department separately said it is weighing new restrictions and reporting requirements on wind developers, including changes that could encourage the use of organized labor and American-made materials. The ocean energy bureau already proposed requiring lease holders to make every reasonable effort to enter into project labor agreements covering projects in a shallow stretch of the Atlantic Ocean between New York’s Long Island and New Jersey."

Oct 13 (Reuters) – A U.S. solar group seeking import tariffs on panels made by Chinese companies in Southeast Asia has refused a request by federal trade officials to reveal its members’ identities, citing fears of retaliation by Beijing, according to a document the group filed with the Commerce Department on Wednesday.

The filing by the group American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) is the latest development in a long-running clash between the small U.S. domestic solar manufacturing industry and a much larger contingent of U.S. solar project builders over Asian imports.

U.S. manufacturers are eager to stamp out low-priced foreign competition, while installers rely heavily on cheap imports to make their businesses profitable.

The domestic group in August asked the Commerce Department to investigate whether imports from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were unfair, arguing that Chinese companies had shifted production to those nations in recent years to avoid existing U.S. duties on solar cells and panels made in China.

Late last month, the Commerce Department deferred a decision on the request and asked the group to identify its members.

In its response to the department, the group refused and argued that identifying its members could expose them to retribution from the Chinese industry, which dominates the global solar supply chain and could cut off supplies of critical solar panel components like polysilicon.

“Affording confidential treatment to the members of A-SMACC is the only way these U.S. companies can protect their vital business interests while seeking their statutory right to request protection from unfair trade practices,” the filing said.

U.S. solar project developers, which make up most of the domestic industry, have lobbied forcefully against new tariffs, saying they would cripple a sector that is critical to meeting the Biden administration’s climate goals."

Green energy needs $4 trln investment by 2030, IEA says

MOSCOW/BRUSSELS/BEIJING, Oct 13 (Reuters) – President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia was not using gas as a weapon and was ready to help ease Europe’s energy crunch as the EU called an emergency summit to tackle skyrocketing prices.

Energy demand has surged as economies have rebounded from the pandemic, driving up prices of oil, gas and coal, stoking inflationary pressures and undermining efforts to cut the use of polluting fossil fuels in the fight against global warming.

China, the world’s second biggest economy and its biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has boosted coal output and imports, as domestic coal prices have hit record levels and power stations have struggled to keep the lights on in homes and factories.

The energy crunch has amplified Wednesday’s call by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for tripling investment in renewables to steady markets and fight climate change.

Europe’s gas squeeze has shone a spotlight on Russia, which accounts for a third of the region’s supplies, prompting European politicians to blame Moscow for not pumping enough.

Putin told an energy conference in Moscow that the gas market was not balanced or predictable, particularly in Europe, but said Russia was meeting its contractual obligations to supply clients and was ready to boost supplies if asked.

He dismissed accusations that Russia was using energy as a weapon: “This is just politically motivated chatter, which has no basis whatsoever.”

The European Union has not asked Russia to increase supplies of gas to the bloc, a European Commission official told Reuters.

Russia and Europe have been embroiled in a dispute over a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, to supply Russian gas to Germany. The pipeline is built but awaits approval to start pumping, amid opposition from the United States and some Europeans nations that fear it will make Europe even more reliant on Russia.

Some European politicians say Moscow is using the fuel crisis as leverage, a charge it has repeatedly denied.

DE-GAS EUROPE

The European Commission outlined measures on Wednesday that the 27-nation EU would take to combat the energy crisis, including exploring a voluntary option for countries to jointly buy gas.

Ministers from EU countries hold an extraordinary meeting on Oct. 26 to discuss the price spike.

“The only way to fully decouple gas from electricity is no longer to use it to generate power,” EU energy policy chief Kadri Simson said. “This is the EU’s long-term goal, to replace fossil fuels with renewables.”

The Paris-based IEA said the world had to invest $4 trillion by 2030 in clean energy and infrastructure – triple current levels – to achieve net zero emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, the target of the 2015 Paris climate accord.

“The world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs,” it said in a report, published before the United Nations COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, which starts on Oct. 31. read more

WINTER SPIKE?

As renewables have failed to fill gaps amid surging demand, oil and gas prices have roared higher.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries trimmed its world oil demand forecast for 2021 but said surging gas prices could mean customers switch to oil.

Benchmark crude was trading close to last week’s more than three-year high above $84 a barrel.

Putin said that oil prices could reach $100 a barrel. “This is quite possible,” he said. “We and our partners at OPEC+ are doing our utmost to stabilise the market.” read more

The benchmark European gas price is up more than 350% this year, trading above $31 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Wednesday, although down from last week’s spike above $52.

“Current prices are above fundamentally justified levels, should remain volatile and could still reach $100/mmBtu or above this season if the weather gets very cold,” Citi bank said as it also raised its forecast for European and Asian benchmark gas prices for the fourth quarter by about $3.

The United States was also likely to feel the pain, according to the Energy Information Administration, which warned on Wednesday that it would cost more to heat U.S. homes this winter. read more

The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG), which monitors security of supply, said a cold winter in Europe would require an increase of gas imports by about 5% to 10% compared to previous maximum levels.

“We’re reaching out to trade partners to discuss if it’s possible to increase their deliveries in the market,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said.

The Commission expects prices to remain high until April 2022. read more

In China, the most-active January Zhengzhou thermal coal futures touched a record high of 1,640 yuan ($254.54) per tonne on Wednesday, up more than 190% so far this year.

Local governments in top Chinese coal producing areas Shanxi and Inner Mongolia ordered about 200 mines to boost output, but rain flooded 60 mines in Shanxi. China’s coal imports surged 76% in September.

Seeking to ease the power crunch, Beijing said it would allow power plants to charge commercial customers market-based prices, breaking with a policy that had allowed industry to lock in fixed-price electricity deals with suppliers.

[],10/13/2021,"Detroit, Oct. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — DETROIT, October 13, 2021 – DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) today announced that it is ceasing all coal use at its Belle River Power Plant in St. Clair County, Michigan no later than December 2028 – at least two years earlier than the facility’s previously scheduled 2030 coal use end date – enabling DTE to achieve its 50% carbon emissions reduction goal faster than planned and moving the company closer to its goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions. This generation action complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) rule.

This action supports DTE’s and Michigan’s journey to net zero carbon emissions. DTE has retired four of its coal-fired facilities (Marysville, Harbor Beach, Conners Creek and River Rouge) and plans to retire two of its four remaining coal plants – St. Clair and Trenton Channel – in 2022, while also exploring other clean energy options for electricity generation.

“A key part of DTE’s Clean Vision Plan involves the sequential retirement of our coal plants,” said Jerry Norcia, chief executive officer, DTE Energy. “By making this important generation decision now, DTE continues to be proactive in improving our reliability, addressing the expanding needs of our customers and accelerating our journey to cleaner energy generation that is affordable for the customers and communities we serve.”

Maintaining Affordability, Reliability & Clean Energy Investments

DTE will further outline its goals to accelerate its journey to cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy in its next Clean Vision Plan (Integrated Resource Plan) filing with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). The Clean Vision Plan will be filed with the MPSC in the fall of 2022, a full year ahead of the required timeline. The updated Clean Vision Plan will be shaped by DTE’s ongoing discussions with customers and other stakeholders in the communities it serves. Through its Clean Vision Plan filing, DTE will provide a detailed assessment of the existing and future energy needs of its customers and how it plans to meet these needs.

As the company invests in more renewable generation it will evaluate a conversion of the Belle River Power Plant to cleaner energy resources. This evaluation will be assessed in future regulatory filings.

Since 2009, DTE has been Michigan’s largest producer of wind and solar energy. DTE’s 50 wind and solar farms generate enough clean energy to power nearly 700,000 homes. By 2025, the energy company will generate enough renewable energy to power approximately 1.3 million homes.

Supporting Employees and Communities

DTE is developing an employee transition strategy that will ensure all employees continue to have the opportunity to contribute to DTE’s success, while also delivering energy that is safe, clean, affordable and reliable for its customers.

DTE intends to deliver on this commitment through several measures that include collaborating with union leadership, workforce re-skilling and employee redeployments.

In advance of ceasing coal use at Belle River, DTE will continue to plan, partner and work closely with community leaders, government officials and local businesses to foster economic development and investment within St. Clair County and throughout Michigan.

[],10/13/2021,"Detroit, Oct. 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — DETROIT, October 12, 2021 — DTE Energy, a leader in clean energy in Michigan, announced today that its electric vehicle (EV) charging program, Charging Forward, is now offering Michigan-based businesses advisory services for transitioning to electric fleets (eFleets).

DTE developed Charging Forward eFleets, a five-year, $13.4 million program to accelerate fleet electrification in Michigan. The program is designed to support fleet owners by facilitating their transition to eFleets and integrating charger load efficiently with the DTE Electric distribution system. The program, which the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized to implement in 2021, offers charger rebates of up to $2,500 for Level 2 ports, up to $5,000 for Opportunity Chargers and up to $70,000 for Direct Current Fast Chargers (DCFCs).

In addition to providing education and charger rebates, eFleets delivers a variety of services that include a customized roadmap for customers to electrify their fleets. This seven-step plan includes an operational assessment of their current fleet, a comprehensive list of available EVs customized for their use case, personalized fuel and load forecasts, applicable chargers, assistance in connecting to the grid, financial modelling, and support for available charger rebates. This service will help customers transition to EVs, which will allow them to gain fuel savings and establish greener fleets.

“Our goal with eFleets is to bring operational savings and sustainability to fleet operators while also bringing the benefits of transportation electrification to society at large,” said Ben Burns, director of electric marketing at DTE Energy. “Our new services will reduce barriers to eFleet adoption for our commercial, industrial and business customers and provide opportunities to pilot integration with new clean technologies.”

DTE launched the Charging Forward program in 2019 with three primary components. The first component is a robust education and outreach effort to support customers throughout their journey to electric mobility. The second component offers a rebate to residential customers that have installed a qualified Level 2 charger and enrolled in a time-of-use (TOU) electric pricing option and has issued over 800 rebates to-date. The final component of the program offers incentives to its business customers to install, own and operate chargers. Since the program began, 921 Level 2 ports and 88 Direct Current Fast Chargers (DCFCs) have been approved.

[],10/13/2021,"“We set a specific aim here — no later than 2060,” Putin said in his speech at the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow. His pledge is the latest in a string of national green commitments being announced ahead of United Nations-sponsored climate talks that kick off in Glasgow, Scotland, at the end of the month.

Russia, one of the world’s leading producers of oil and its fourth-biggest greenhouse-gas emitter, has so far resisted international pressure to slow global warming, and Putin has until recently dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures. The nation ratified the 2015 Paris climate agreement two years ago, but took little action until Putin ordered the development of a carbon strategy in June. He signed a climate law in July creating a framework for green projects and development of carbon trading.

Most large economies aim to eliminate their emissions by 2050. Only China, which still counts itself as a developing country, also has a carbon neutrality goal of 2060. Putin’s comments were the first official confirmation that Russia might finally take steps to start moving its economy away from fossil fuels.

The plan was under consideration earlier this month, a person familiar with the situation said last week. Russia is also weighing a pledge to cut net carbon dioxide emissions by 79% from 2019 to 2050, according to a carbon strategy draft seen by Bloomberg News. The document is currently under discussion by ministers, the Economy Ministry’s press service said. It may change before the Glasgow talks."
[],10/13/2021,"Analytical intelligence systems are the key to unlocking the data to drive your business forward.

CALGARY, October 13, 2021 — In today’s fast changing world, leaders are pressed to do more with existing or even less resources. This means, finding efficiencies in the current systems and processes through innovative approaches. Streamline Control, an Alberta-based company leading in industrial internet of things (IIoT) technology, explains that having the right access and insights to your analytical data assets is the driving force behind any successful organization.

There are two types of data in an organization: operational data which is created from an organization’s day to day operations and analytical data which is the operational data used to make business decisions. Furthermore, operational data systems consist of transactional data and are built for quick updates. Whereas analytical data systems are tools that digest the operational data and translate them into meaningful analysis to inform better decision making.

Having the right analytical data system allows organizations to access and draw insights from their operational data which play a significant role in making the right decisions to turn marginal growth into exponential growth. In a mature industry such as oil and gas, many are still using outdated tools and technology which created data siloes. As a result, by the time the right data gets to the decision makers, they are either outdated or irrelevant. This lack of access results in detrimental effects on the organization and the risks are too high to ignore. There is a dire need to modernize, bridge, and enable operational data technology to maintain a competitive edge against competitors.

Streamline works with clients to break down the walls between the field and boardroom to cultivate real-time data to ensure accurate insights that support intelligently informed decision-making across the business and ultimately drive success. Streamline builds future-proofed systems to allow organizations tap into their current data. Having this access to the right data puts business leaders in a position of power to drive growth.

“At Streamline, we have experts not only in Operational Data technologies like OSISoft, but experts in the control and communication operational processes,” states Jeremiah Hannley, Chief Technology Officer at Streamline. “We will give your team a complete picture of your operational ecosystem. Together, we can help you support, architect and enhance your current Operational Data systems. The most important thing is to be proactive now to secure a better position for your business tomorrow.”
