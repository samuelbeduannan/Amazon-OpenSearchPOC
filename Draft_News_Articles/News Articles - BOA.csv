I’m not sure what is politically incorrect, what isn’t these days, but screw it – some aspects of history are just too absurd to not be amused by. It becomes even funnier when, subjected to certain lenses of political correctness, the mirth is multiplied into top-notch black humour. In today’s sermon, colonialism provides just such a wonderful tipping-of-the-table.

Consider a cultural oddity of last century – ‘cargo cults’ that appeared in some undeveloped countries like Papua New Guinea. Locals were ‘blessed’ with visits from Europeans, who came ashore from huge boats. A primary influence the Europeans left behind was Pidgin English, a shorthand version of English that is endearingly direct (Prince Philip became known on some shores as “Fella belong Missus Queen”). A sadder aspect was the development of cargo cults – simple-living people with little exposure to the outer world who were mesmerized by the bountiful, strange, wonderful objects brought ashore by foreigners. They associated this stuff with the arrival of ships, and many watched and waited years for ships to return, and with them, more miraculous cargo.

Mock those people at your peril, for now the tables have turned in a poetic-justice manner. Those same colonialists that landed ashore Papua New Guinea, bringing the stench of royalty and bedazzling primitive tribes with Euro-goods, are now standing on the shores of the UK, staring out to sea, desperately hoping to see an LNG cargo ship arrive, and Papua New Guinea might very well be the home of that LNG.

Karma has a sense of humour.

Nothing against your energy crisis, UK; it truly is a tragedy in the making. The dart of accountability is aimed more at the foreheads of the climate lunatics you’ve let take the wheel. Their boneheadedness is truly breathtaking; it’s like they are standing on the deck of the Titanic staring down at the gaping hole in the side, and declaring that what the ship needs first and foremost is a salad bar. Hey, our governments have been infiltrated by those termites also, so I’m not laughing; I guess the only difference is that, since our oil/gas sector is rather critical to the economy over here, our government is having a much harder time killing it.

Here in Canada, some of us would love to help out. We would love to send you some natural gas. We have a lot. We just can’t get it to you, because we have federal leaders that care far more about what the UN thinks than about how to manage and run a country. A whole country, that is. Putin builds Europe a gas line, then plays games to maximize the haul of rubles. Canada chooses to not even get in the game.

We are working on LNG export capability, despite some bizarre internal obstacles. A few terminals may be ready a few years after you freeze to death. If you want to know why we can’t get you any natural gas, a good local place to start for the British is with the whack jobs at Extinction Rebellion, the piteous group of flailing and ignorant anarchists that originated there and spread over here like wildfire, a sort of COVID-18. You can have them back, by the way; they block roads, annoy everyone, convince no one, and wander in circles evading reality until the next siren song beckons them to assemble again in a formation of human mosquitoes.

For full disclosure, we would love to get you some natural gas not just to keep you from freezing to death, but because extracting and selling natural gas pays a lot of the bills. It would pay a hell of a lot more of them if we could get you some of our gas. Erudite industry veteran Dave Yeager posted an excellent synopsis of the issue on Twitter last week: In late September, AECO gas traded at C$2.72/GJ, US Henry Hub gas traded at US$5.03/mmbtu (approx C$6/GJ), and Asian LNG traded at US$29/mmbtu (approximately infinity compared to Canada’s pathetic number).

Canadian producers are forced to sell at this bargain basement price because we can’t get the product to global market, where it would be most welcome. Canadians are generally oblivious to the amount of money being left on the table, not to mention oblivious to your thundering need for the stuff.

Because your situation there in Europe is so dire, I don’t really have the heart to point out that the piano really is being moved over your head, and XR is cutting the rope. “China’s central government officials ordered the country’s top state-owned energy companies — from coal to electricity and oil — to secure supplies for this winter at all costs, according to people familiar with the matter,” noted Bloomberg in a (sorry) firewall-protected article. Good luck competing with them. Over here in Canada, we would liken that to a grizzly bear and a French poodle squaring off over a pork chop. Not being disrespectful of Britain’s might, mind you; just pointing out that China has 1.3 billion people to keep from revolting, and they are running for the buffet and will shoulder check anyone out of the way without blinking.

I really am loathe to inform you though that it gets worse. Much worse. In nearby India, where coal accounts for almost half of the country’s energy production, more than half of India’s 135 coal-fired power plants have only enough coal to last only three days. Government guidelines suggest a two-week supply. India also has over a billion people, and is also on a life-and-death scramble for hydrocarbons in any form. The UK’s 70 million well-looked-after citizens are going head to head with 2.5 billion that need those same fuels for survival.

And on that note, please don’t take the above bits of levity as a failure to grasp the seriousness of this global situation. A cold winter will be devastating for much of the world’s population, and I’m not talking about a government directive to set the thermostat to 65.

As one clown on Twitter put it, we are past gas-to-oil switching and approaching gas-to-furniture switching. The headlines get ever more ominous. Ten days ago, it was European zinc processors that were cutting output, now, as of early October, massive Dutch greenhouses are going dark and cutting output. I had no idea how huge Dutch greenhouses are, exporting over ten billion in food, but I’m sure you knew that, being neighbours. To make the point crystal clear to any apoplectic activists listening in, that’s the food supply shutting down, folks.

Make no mistake: this catastrophe has been purposefully engineered by energy charlatans and organizations that convinced the world it no longer needs hydrocarbons and can begin dismantling the hydrocarbon system. Every ENGO celebration of a blocked pipeline is a direct and irrefutable piece of evidence should the unthinkable happen. The games are over. It would be really great to be just writing about positive energy developments, like a burgeoning hydrogen economy, or whatnot, and if the ‘transition’ had occurred in a rational way, that would be the story. But it’s not, and wishing you all the best that those cargo ships appear on the horizon. And soon.

[],10/5/2021,"CALGARY, AB – Perpetual Energy Inc. (“Perpetual” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the closing of the previously announced financings of Rubellite Energy Inc. (“Rubellite”), the repayment of its second lien term loan and credit facility extension, and provide an operations update.

Rubellite Financings

Rubellite has raised $83.5 million in equity, all priced at $2.00 per share, through a combination of: (i) a $33.5 million arrangement warrant financing (the “Arrangement Warrant Financing”) whereby shareholders of Perpetual were provided the opportunity to purchase Rubellite common shares (“Rubellite Shares”) in addition to those Rubellite Shares issued under the reorganization of the Company, which was approved by the shareholders on August 31, 2021; (ii) the issuance of Rubellite Shares in exchange for subscription receipts previously issued under a $30 million brokered private placement to a number of arm’s length investors, which funds have been held in escrow since closing on July 13, 2021 (the “Brokered Private Placement”); and (iii) a $20 million non-brokered private placement (the “Non-Brokered Private Placement” and collectively with the Arrangement Warrant Financing and Brokered Private Placement, the “Rubellite Financings”). The Rubellite Financings closed concurrently on October 4, 2021 and approximately 41.7 million Rubellite Shares were issued.

Approximately $53.6 million in funds from the Rubellite Financings will today repay promissory notes owed to Perpetual in connection with Rubellite’s acquisition of its Clearwater assets from Perpetual. Perpetual previously received additional non-cash consideration in the form of a five-year option to purchase 4.0 million Rubellite Shares at $3.00 per share (the “Rubellite Share Purchase Options”), providing an opportunity for Perpetual to remain exposed to potential value appreciation of the Clearwater assets sold to Rubellite.

With payments enabled through the closing of the Rubellite Financings, Perpetual’s total net debt will decline by an estimated 46% from $110 million at June 30, 2021 to approximately $59 million, inclusive of estimated capital spending at East Edson and other forecast corporate revenues and expenses during the third quarter of 2021. Interest cost savings will improve Perpetual’s liquidity by approximately $4 million annually. The general and administrative cost recoveries under the management services agreement with Rubellite are expected to further enhance Perpetual’s liquidity by approximately $2 to $3 million annually.

Second Lien Term Loan Repayment

Pursuant to the terms of the second lien debt repayment agreement with Alberta Investment Management Corporation, Perpetual has settled its $45 million second lien term loan principal plus outstanding interest with the payment of approximately $38.5 million in cash, delivery of 680,485 Rubellite Shares and later today will enter into a new second lien term loan of $2.7 million (the “New Second Lien Term Loan”). The New Second Lien Term Loan bears interest at 8.1% annually, which Perpetual may elect to pay-in-kind, and will mature on December 31, 2024. Perpetual has the ability to repay any or all of the New Second Lien Term Loan at any time without penalty. Perpetual is also committed to pay up to $4.5 million in contingent payments in the event that Perpetual’s annual average realized crude oil and natural gas prices exceed certain thresholds over the three year period ended December 31, 2023.

Credit Facility Extension

On July 15, 2021, Perpetual entered into an agreement with its syndicate of lenders to extend its revolving bank debt facility (“First Lien Credit Facility”) upon closing of the Rubellite Financings. The First Lien Credit Facility established a borrowing limit of $17 million, with an initial term to November 30, 2022 unless the revolving period is extended for a further six months subject to approval by the syndicate. If not extended on or before November 30, 2022, all outstanding advances will be repayable on May 31, 2023. The next Borrowing Limit redetermination is scheduled on or before November 30, 2021.

Including cash proceeds received from the sale of the Clearwater assets, Perpetual expects to be less than 25% drawn on the $17 million First Lien Credit Facility. Furthermore, the First Lien Credit Facility provides Perpetual with an enhanced ability to enter into risk management contracts to mitigate commodity price risk as appropriate.

Operations Update

The Rubellite transactions provide a full capital solution for Perpetual by reducing Perpetual’s net debt, normalizing the balance sheet leverage ratios and enhancing Perpetual’s ability to capture the inherent value in its asset base by funding investment opportunities to grow and sustain production and adjusted funds flow.

Operationally, the Company is participating in an active capital program at Perpetual’s 50% working interest East Edson property. The last well of the 8-well carried interest commitment that formed part of the consideration in the East Edson transaction in April 2020 was spud on July 26, 2021 and was drilled, completed and brought onstream by our joint venture partner in August. An additional six well (3.0 net) drilling program at East Edson is well advanced with the first two-well pad drilled, completed and on production in mid-September, ahead of previous expectations. Drilling operations are continuing on the final four-well pad, with production start-up expected by early November, targeting to fill the West Wolf gas plant to maximize natural gas and NGL sales through next winter.

Activity in Mannville in Eastern Alberta remains focused on waterflood optimization and battery consolidation projects and preparation for potential drilling projects in 2022."
[],10/5/2021,"Financings

Rubellite has raised $83.5 million in equity, all priced at $2.00 per share, through a combination of: (i) a $33.5 million arrangement warrant financing (the “Arrangement Warrant Financing”) whereby shareholders of Perpetual Energy Inc. (“Perpetual”) were issued arrangement warrants (the “Arrangement Warrants”) which provided them the opportunity to purchase Rubellite common shares (“Rubellite Shares”) in addition to those Rubellite Shares issued under a reorganization of Perpetual, approved by its shareholders on August 31, 2021; (ii) the issuance of Rubellite Shares on exchange of the subscription receipts previously issued under a $30 million brokered private placement to a number of arm’s length investors, which funds have been held in escrow since closing July 13, 2021 (the “Brokered Private Placement”); and (iii) the concurrent closing of the maximum $20 million raised through the fully subscribed non-brokered private placement (the “Non-Brokered Private Placement” and together with the Arrangement Warrant Financing and Brokered Private Placement, the “Financings”). The Financings resulted in the issuance of approximately 41.7 million Rubellite Shares.

Proceeds from the Financings fully repay $59.4 million in promissory notes related to the acquisition of the Company’s Clearwater assets from Perpetual.

In combination with the approximately 2.1 million Rubellite Shares issued on September 3, 2021 which formed the initial capitalization of Rubellite, the Company now has approximately 43.8 million Rubellite Shares outstanding, no debt and a working capital surplus of an estimated $22.5 million. Through its participation in the Arrangement Warrant Financing and in the Non-Brokered Private Placement, Alberta Investment Management Corporation owns approximately 8.3% of the Rubellite Shares and Sue Riddell Rose, the Company’s President and CEO, and certain entities controlled by her, owns, controls or directs, directly and indirectly, 32.0% of the Rubellite Shares. In addition, Perpetual has a five year option to purchase 4.0 million Rubellite Shares at an exercise price of $3.00 per share.

New Credit Facility

Rubellite will also today enter into a first lien credit facility with a syndicate of lenders to establish a new $3 million revolving credit facility with an initial term to May 31, 2022 and which may be extended for a further twelve months to May 31, 2023 subject to lender approval.

Operations Update

Rubellite currently has fourteen (13.0 net) producing multi-lateral wells on production, including the six (6.0 net) original wells drilled by Perpetual at Ukalta and the one (1.0 net) producing 2.5 leg multi-lateral well at Figure Lake acquired in January 2020. New wells that have been drilled, completed and commenced production include two (1.0 net) wells at Marten Hills which were rig released in early July, four (4.0 net) producing wells at Figure Lake and the first (1.0 net) of the planned eight well 2021 drilling program at Ukalta. Sales production is expected to ramp up as new wells fully recover load oil from the drilling process, which is recycled for future drilling operations, and volumes commence delivery to sales terminals.

Sales production at Marten Hills commenced in late August after fully recovering load oil from drilling operations and the eight leg multi-lateral wells on average are performing at Rubellite’s Marten Hills IP30 type curve production level of approximately 120 bbl/d of 22o API crude oil each. Two of the four new Figure Lake wells, each of which penetrated over 8,000 meters of Clearwater reservoir, were brought onstream August 26, 2021 and have recently begun producing formation oil for sales after a three-week period of load oil recovery. Two additional exploratory new wells over 10 miles north of the producing Figure Lake pad site have been drilled, completed and turned over to production operations, and have begun recovering load oil from drilling operations.

As previously planned, drilling activity has progressed to the Ukalta property where one (1.0 net) six-leg multi-lateral well has been drilled, completed and recently turned over to operations to commence load oil recovery and sales production. Rubellite’s planned single-rig drilling program for the remainder of 2021 consists of an additional seven (7.0 net) multi-lateral wells at Ukalta."

Michigan's Mackinac bridge, under which Enbridge's line 5 pipeline runs.

Canada on Monday formally invoked a 1977 treaty with the United States to request bilateral negotiations over Enbridge Inc ’s Line 5, escalating a long-running dispute over one of Canada’s major oil export pipelines.

Line 5 ships 540,000 barrels per day of crude and refined products from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, but the state of Michigan ordered Enbridge to shut it down due to worries a leak could develop in a four-mile section running beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes.

Enbridge ignored Michigan’s order and the sides are embroiled in a legal battle. The government of Canada has been pushing counterparts in the United States to intervene, and Monday’s move marks a step up in Ottawa’s efforts to help safeguard the pipeline.

In a letter to the federal judge presiding over the case, Gordon Giffin, legal counsel for the Canadian government, said Canada had formally invoked Article Six of the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty.

The treaty has never been invoked before.

Line 5 is governed by the provisions of the 1977 agreement, which guarantees the uninterrupted transit of light crude oil and natural gas liquids between the two countries, Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement.

“Today, Canada is formally invoking the dispute settlement provision of the 1977 Agreement to ensure its full application,” Garneau said.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Article Six is the process used by the treaty to resolve disputes, and Giffin’s letter asked the court to halt any proceedings related to Michigan’s Line 5 shutdown order while that is ongoing, a move criticised by environmental campaigners.

“The government of Canada took an action today that ignores the risk of an oil spill in the Great Lakes and seems clearly designed to delay a legal decision to shut down Enbridge’s twin Line 5 oil pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac,” said Sean McBrearty, co-ordinator for environmentalists Oil & Water Don’t Mix.

Earlier this year Enbridge and Michigan took part in court-ordered mediation, but Enbridge spokeswoman Tracy Larsson said Michigan has said it is not committed to further talks.

“We greatly appreciate the efforts of ‘Team Canada’ – from the Government of Canada to the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Saskatchewan for their commitments and efforts to keep Line 5 open,” she said in an email."

Alberta oil well in canola field

Oil prices jumped Monday after OPEC and allied oil-producing countries stayed with their gradual approach to restoring output slashed during the pandemic, agreeing to add only 400,000 barrels per day in November.

The decision Monday by the Vienna-based oil cartel tracks with its established schedule of adding back that amount of oil every month until deep cuts made in 2020 to support prices during the depth of the pandemic recession are restored next year.

The situation has changed since then as the global economy recovers. The decision comes amid stronger demand for oil products like gasoline and jet fuel, as driving and flying pick up around the globe due to the easing of restrictions aimed at containing the COVID-19 pandemic.

On top of that, unusually high prices for natural gas are pushing some electricity producers in Asia to switch from natural gas to oil-based products, helping support prices.

The Brent international benchmark hit a new 3-year high at $81.67, up 2.8% on the day, the highest since 2014. West Texas Intermediate hit $78.06, up $2.34 or 3.09%

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised concerns about rising oil prices when he met officials in Saudi Arabia earlier this week in talks that largely focused on the war in Yemen, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Sullivan and other members of his delegation reiterated the importance of creating conditions to support the global economic recovery caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the official added.

Last week White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that White House officials have stayed in communication with OPEC about prices and were looking for tools to address the issue as Brent crude topped $80 per barrel last month.

U.S. national average gasoline prices have been holding steady at around $3.20 per gallon in recent days, according to motoring club federation AAA, which foresaw stable short-term gas prices with supply and demand “largely in sync.” The average is 97 cents more than a year ago."

U.S. natural gas futures jumped over 7% to a fresh seven-year high on Monday on forecasts power generators will burn more of the fuel this week than previously expected and as record global gas prices keep demand for more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports strong.

Even though the weather is expected to remain milder than normal on average across the United States through mid October, lingering pockets of warm were still expected to keep air conditioners humming in some parts of the country this week.

Gas prices around the world have soared to all-time highs for several days in a row as low stockpiles in Europe and insatiable demand in Asia cause the two regions to compete for spare LNG cargoes. Prices in Europe jumped over 80% in September, rising a seventh month in a row, as the amount of gas in storage in some European countries fell to dangerously low levels ahead of the winter heating season.

Analysts have said that gas stockpiles in some European countries were over 20% below normal for this time of year. In the United States, meanwhile, inventories were expected to reach about 3.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) by the end of October. Analysts said that should be enough for the U.S. winter heating season even though that amount would fall short of the 3.7 tcf five-year (2016-2020) average for that time of year.

Front-month gas futures rose 40 cents, or 7.1%, to $6.019 per million British thermal units at 9:50 a.m. EDT (1350 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since February 2014.

Speculators boosted their net long positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges last week for the first time in three weeks as record global prices helped the U.S. front-month climb over 9% in volatile trade, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to an average of 91.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in October from 91.1 bcfd in September. That compares with a monthly record of 95.4 bcfd in November 2019.

Refinitiv projected that U.S. gas demand, including exports, would slide from an average of 85.0 bcfd this week to 83.6 bcfd next week as the weather turns milder. Those forecasts were higher than Refinitiv expected on Friday.

With gas prices at or near record highs of $33 per mmBtu in Europe and $31 in Asia, versus around $6 in the United States, traders said buyers around the world would keep purchasing all the LNG the United States could produce.

With Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s Cove Point LNG export plant expected to remain shut for another week for planned maintenance, Refinitiv said the amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slipped modestly to an average of 10.3 bcfd so far in October from 10.4 bcfd in September.

But no matter how high global prices rise, the United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcfd of gas into LNG. Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode."

OPEC and its allies meet on Monday to debate how much oil to release into the red hot market, where supply disruptions and recovering demand from the coronavirus pandemic have pushed oil above $80 per barrel.

The oil price rally to a three-year high is exacerbated by an even bigger increase in gas prices, which have spiked 300% and have come to trade close to an equivalent of $200 per barrel due to supply shortages and low production of other fuels.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+, agreed in July to boost output by 400,000 barrels per day every month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bpd of existing cuts.

Four OPEC+ sources told Reuters last week producers were considering adding more than that deal envisaged, but none gave details on how much more, or when supply would increase.

The nearest month any increase could occur is November since OPEC+’s last meeting decided the October volumes.

Rising oil, gas, coal and power prices are feeding inflationary pressures worldwide and slowing the recovery.

A senior aide to U.S. President Joe Biden met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss the war in Yemen but said oil was also “of concern.”

Russian oil and gas condensate output rose to 10.72 million bpd in September, the highest level since the 11.34 million bpd pumped in April 2020, data showed on Saturday."
['Maureen Mccall'],10/4/2021,"











As we continue with the fourth wave of the Covid 19 pandemic, industries face the reality that manufacturing supply chains across several sectors are expecting long-term disruptions.

Disruption of plastic resin supply, namely the polymers and other derivatives produced in the plastic value chain has come to the forefront of public discussion as the reality of enduring disruption and price shock sinks in.

Converging events

There’s a confluence of a number of factors, both on the supply and demand side affecting the supply chain crunch for resins. Covid-19 covers part of it, but it is not the entire story. There have been many supply-demand challenges for plastic resins. Some are Covid-19 related, some weather-related in 2020 and 2021 and some are due to global trade issues.

In the equation of supply versus demand, for many materials, the elements are out of balance. Currently, there are demand-side issues and supply-side issues, but you’re getting a widening gulf between the two sides resulting in elevated pricing.

Since resin is a critical raw ingredient that is the building block of many plastic products that are ubiquitous in our daily lives, globally we are facing long-term supply chain disruption- rapid price escalation and enduring high prices. Industry predicts the ongoing shortage of resins is unlikely to be resolved quickly and we will continue to see price hikes that inflate the cost of consumer necessities – adding to inflation.

“The problem is really the sustained price increase, for most plastic resins you’re looking at anywhere from 80 to 150% price per ton increase over last 12 months- so it’s pretty substantive.” according to Bob Masterson, President and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada



Covid 19 as a key driver

Looking at the demand first, Covid is one of the key drivers of this imbalance.

The pandemic created a sudden, massive demand for single-use plastic products- masks, face shields, gloves, syringes, and gowns and all the packaging used to transport them and keep them sterile for use.

As reported recently in Scientific American,

“COVID-19 triggered an estimated global use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves every month. “The oil market collapsed, making plastic cheaper to use than ever. It is now extremely advantageous to package your goods in newly made, cheap virgin plastic. And while takeout has been the saving grace for many restaurants, it’s also contributing to the growing heap of single-use plastic globally. Recycling systems around the world are starting to break down because of COVID-19 budget strains.”

A Shift in consumer buying habits

The pandemic changed our daily activities and shifted consumer buying habits. Stockpiling groceries surged demand for products – all wrapped in plastic -while plastic use to wrap or bag food for both in-store and online purchases also surged. Food dollars were shifted away from restaurants — which buy food in bulk containers — to grocery stores that use much more plastic packaging. As home improvement surged, the price of lumber peaked and consumers turned to materials made with plastics like composite decking.

According to Bob Masterson,

“All this is built on a global plastics industry that grows at one and a half to two times global GDP year after year for the last 70 years since World War Two. In addition to increased demand, new construction was put on hold as companies weren’t sure of their financial position. You saw large corporations suspend their CapEx programs – companies like Inter Pipeline in Alberta or Nova Chemicals in Ontario that had major construction underway, They had to slow it down to make workplace accommodations for Covid exposure. So we saw sustained demand increase at a time that we’re not building the new facilities in the past two years to support normal growth. “

Perfect Storms and Plastic Plant Shutdowns

The majority of North America’s plastics industry is located in the US Gulf Coast and three very serious weather disruptions affected some important facilities in 2020-2021.

In summer 2020, Hurricane Laura shut down many big Gulf Coast polymer producers, suspending 15% of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) production according to a report in canplastics.com.

In addition, the winter 2021 Texas ice freeze occurred in February 2021. As reported by Wood Mackenzie in March 2021, there were lingering impacts from the deep freeze. “The Gulf Coast ‘freeze’ in Texas during February 2021 had another devastating impact on the plastics industry, shutting down major production facilities for polyethylene and polypropylene and decimating the power grid. The freeze alone caused an estimated 12% reduction in US polyethylene production.

When Hurricane Ida arrived on Aug 29th, there were still some facilities that had not come back online since the February storm which was devastating for the chemical and energy sector. The result was a big demand increase because of various factors of COVID and sudden supply challenges.

Masterson says there are further complications,

“On the supply side, we see in Alberta and Ontario, large petrochemical facilities that have to undergo a major maintenance activity every two to three years and shut down for six to eight to twelve weeks during that time. Thousands of workers come on-site to support those turnarounds. In 2020 none of those maintenance turnarounds took place due to Covid and there is a physical limit to how long the facilities can run without a turnaround. Now in 2021, you’ve got normally scheduled maintenance plus the maintenance that was missed last year. At the current prices, the facilities would continue to produce as long as possible but will be forced to shut down at some point to complete that deferred maintenance from 2020.”

All these issues in terms of demand & supply are driving record prices

Price Makers vs Price Takers?

If we look at polyethylene, Canada is a global-scale producer. 80% of all the polyethylene resin we make in Canada is exported – largely to the United States- so we are a very significant exporter. When you look at polypropylene resin, today we don’t produce any. The new Inter Pipeline project will give us a domestic source of polypropylene. 100% of whatever polypropylene we use in Canada now is coming from offshore. As a country, our plastics are part of the energy value chain. We have world-class, low-carbon, well-priced natural gas liquids in Western Canada that we can use for feedstock.

Masterson asks:

“So why can’t we get more plastics on the world markets? I talk often about the missed opportunities Canada has had. There has been about one and a half to two times global GDP growth. The U.S. in the past seven years has seen 300 new chemical plant expansions/chemical plant investments. That’s about $300 billion of new investment. In Canada, we would have expected/would have seen 30 projects- $30 billion in new investment instead we have about $7 billion underway, so we’ve missed incredible opportunities.”

Masterson wonders if Canada has become a fly-over destination for the global chemistry sector with the exception perhaps of Alberta? He questions why we don’t strive, as a nation, to be more self-sufficient. The world needs the materials we can produce and they need them at the price, the quality and the low-carbon footprint we can offer. So why can’t we get more of that product into the global market?

Masterson says Alberta is doing the right thing to be on the radar of the global chemistry industry, so investments are at least being invited and incentivized. He sees the municipal governments, like the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association, are very supportive. If we look at the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association, they’re looking at $30 billion of new investment in the region by 2030. Municipally and provincially, Alberta is doing everything possible to secure the interests and to secure tangible investments in the future. We only have one very large project with shovels in the ground right now but you have a number of publicly made proposals and a large number of discussions happening behind the scenes.

Masterson’s main message is clear. The largest commodity chemical in the world is ethylene, which is the precursor to polyethylene- which is in turn, the most widely consumed plastic globally. So for every ton of polyethylene, we make in Alberta, we can do it with half the greenhouse gas content of polyethylene produced in a jurisdiction that makes its plastics out of crude oil. He points out that two-thirds of the world still makes its plastics out of crude oil.

“Alberta can be leaders in low-carbon production. My point is we have access to world-class, high-quality, well-priced natural gas liquids that are low-carbon because of their links to carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production – top priorities for Alberta and that will reduce the industry’s GHG footprint.

More particularly, this press release contains statements concerning management’s expectations and assumptions concerning the anticipated benefits of the Transaction and the transaction metrics related thereto; the timing of various matters in connection with the Transaction and the conditions to completion of the Transaction; and Surge’s revised guidance for the remainder of 2021 and preliminary guidance for 2022. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Surge, including expectations and assumptions the performance of existing wells and success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated expenses, cash flow and capital expenditures; the application of regulatory and royalty regimes; prevailing commodity prices and economic conditions; development and completion activities; the performance of new wells; the successful implementation of waterflood programs; the availability of and performance of facilities and pipelines; the geological characteristics of Surge’s properties; the successful application of drilling, completion and seismic technology; the determination of decommissioning liabilities; prevailing weather conditions; exchange rates; licensing requirements; the impact of completed facilities on operating costs; the availability and costs of capital, labour and services; and the creditworthiness of industry partners.

The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Surge, including expectations and assumptions the performance of existing wells and success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated expenses, cash flow and capital expenditures; the application of regulatory and royalty regimes; prevailing commodity prices and economic conditions; development and completion activities; the performance of new wells; the successful implementation of waterflood programs; the availability of and performance of facilities and pipelines; the geological characteristics of Surge’s properties; the successful application of drilling, completion and seismic technology; the determination of decommissioning liabilities; prevailing weather conditions; exchange rates; licensing requirements; the impact of completed facilities on operating costs; the availability and costs of capital, labour and services; and the creditworthiness of industry partners.

Although Surge believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Surge can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the condition of the global economy, including trade, public health (including the impact of COVID-19) and other geopolitical risks; risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks); commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations and constraint in the availability of services, adverse weather or break-up conditions; uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; and failure to obtain the continued support of the lenders under Surge’s bank line. Certain of these risks are set out in more detail in Surge’s AIF dated March 9, 2021 and in Surge’s MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2020, both of which have been filed on SEDAR and can be accessed at www.sedar.com.

Oil and Gas Advisories

The term “boe” means barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 1 boe to 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 1 boe for 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. “Boe/d” and “boepd” mean barrel of oil equivalent per day. Bbl means barrel of oil and “bopd” means barrels of oil per day. NGLs means natural gas liquids.

This press release contains certain oil and gas metrics and defined terms which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar metrics/terms presented by other issuers and may differ by definition and application. All oil and gas metrics/terms used in this document are defined below:

Original Oil in Place (“OOIP”) means Discovered Petroleum Initially In Place (“DPIIP”). DPIIP is derived by Surge’s internal Qualified Reserve Evaluators (“QRE”) and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluations Handbook (“COGEH”). DPIIP, as defined in COGEH, is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes production, reserves and Resources Other Than Reserves (ROTR). OOIP/DPIIP and potential recovery rate estimates are based on current recovery technologies. There is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate recoverability and commercial viability of any of the resource associated with OOIP/DPIIP, and as such a recovery project cannot be defined for a volume of OOIP/DPIIP at this time. “Internally estimated” means an estimate that is derived by Surge’s internal QRE’s and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities. All internal estimates contained in this new release have been prepared effective as of Jan 1, 2021.

Net of Surge disposition from March 25, 2021, the pro forma Company (Surge + Astra + Fire Sky) will have 2020YE TPP reserves of 104.5mmboe. Fire Sky reserves have been evaluated by Sproule from 2016YE through to 2020YE. Similarly, Sproule has evaluated all of Surge’s assets from 2015YE to 2020YE.

Production efficiencies are calculated by dividing capital expenditures of a project by the average production from that project for a given period of time. IP180 is the average production rate of a well over the first 180 days on production.

Drilling Inventory

This press release discloses drilling locations in two categories: (i) booked locations; and (ii) unbooked locations. Booked locations are proved locations and probable locations derived from an internal evaluation using standard practices as prescribed in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluations Handbook and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable.

Unbooked locations are internal estimates based on prospective acreage and assumptions as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources. Unbooked locations have been identified by Surge’s internal certified Engineers and Geologists (who are also Qualified Reserve Evaluators) as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company actually drills wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors. While certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been de-risked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations, the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production.

Surge’s review of Fire Sky’s inventory supports > 100 gross (>100 net) internally estimated drilling locations. Fire Sky’s February 2021 Year End reserves has 118.4 net booked locations. Of these, 68.2 net are Proved locations and 50.2 net are Probable locations based on Sproule’s evaluation.

Net of Surge March 25, 2021 disposition, the pro forma Company (Surge + Fire Sky) will have over >1,050 gross (>975 net) drilling locations identified herein, of these >450 gross (>400 net) are unbooked locations. Of the 562 net booked locations identified herein, 415 net are Proved locations and 147 net are Probable locations based on Sproule’s 2020YE reserves. Assuming an average number of net wells drilled per year of 75, Surge’s >975 net locations provide 13 years of drilling.

Surge’s internally developed type curves (for both Surge and Fire Sky) were constructed using a representative, factual and balanced analog data set, as of Jan 1, 2021 for Surge type curves and July 1, 2021 for Fire Sky type curves. All locations were risked appropriately, and EUR’s were measured against OOIP estimates to ensure a reasonable recovery factor was being achieved based on the respective spacing assumption. Other assumptions, such as capital, operating expenses, wellhead offsets, land encumbrances, working interests and NGL yields were all reviewed, updated and accounted for on a well by well basis by Surge’s Qualified Reserve Evaluators. All type curves fully comply with Part 5.8 of the Companion Policy 51 – 101CP.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Certain secondary financial measures in this press release – including, “cash flow”, “adjusted funds flow”, “free cash flow”, and “net debt” are not prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses the information to analyze business performance, cash flow generated from the business, leverage and liquidity, resulting from the Company’s principal business activities and it may be useful to investors on the same basis. None of these measures are used to enhance the Company’s reported financial performance or position. The non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. They are common in the reports of other companies but may differ by definition and application. All non-GAAP financial measures used in this document are defined below:

Cash Flow & Adjusted Funds Flow

Cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital. The Company further adjusts cash flow from operating activities in calculating adjusted funds flow for changes in decommissioning expenditures and transaction and other costs. Management believes the timing of collection, payment or incurrence of these items involves a high degree of discretion and as such may not be useful for evaluating Surge’s cash flows. Changes in non-cash working capital are a result of the timing of cash flows related to accounts receivable and accounts payable, which management believes reduces comparability between periods. Management views decommissioning expenditures predominately as a discretionary allocation of capital, with flexibility to determine the size and timing of decommissioning programs to achieve greater capital efficiencies and as such, costs may vary between periods. Transaction and other costs represent expenditures associated with acquisitions, which management believes do not reflect the ongoing cash flows of the business, and as such reduces comparability. Each of these expenditures, due to their nature, are not considered principal business activities and vary between periods, which management believes reduces comparability.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital less exploration and development capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow to determine the amount of funds available to the Company for future capital allocation decisions.

Free cash flow per share is calculated using the same weighted average basic and diluted shares used in calculating income per share.

Free cash flow yield is calculated as free cash flow divided by the Company’s share price at the date indicated herein. Management uses this measure as an indication of the cash flow return to shareholders based on current share prices.

Net Debt

There is no comparable measure in accordance with IFRS for net debt. Net debt is calculated as bank debt, term debt, plus the liability component of the convertible debentures plus or minus working capital, however, excluding the fair value of financial contracts, decommissioning obligations, and lease and other obligations. This metric is used by management to analyze the level of debt in the Company including the impact of working capital, which varies with timing of settlement of these balances.

Net debt to annualized adjusted funds flow ratio is calculated as net debt divided by annualized three month adjusted funds flow (adjusted funds flow for the quarter multiplied by four). Management uses this ratio to assess the period of time that it would take to fund net debt based on the adjusted funds flow from the quarter.

All-in payout ratio

All-in payout ratio is calculated as exploration and development expenditures divided by cash flow.

Southern Alberta Oil Well

Oil prices shook off losses to turn positive on Thursday on indications that the United States may not release emergency crude reserves to combat rising gasoline costs, putting focus back on tight global supply.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil gained $1.34, or 1.74%, to $78.26 a barrel, recovering from $74.96.

Brent futures rose $1.13, or 1.40%, to $81.94 a barrel, after falling to a session low of $79.08.

“Right now, it looks like the U.S. is signalling that they’re not planning just yet to tap their strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), and that’s kick-starting this rally here,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.

“This is still too early for the U.S. to consider tapping their reserves and we would see them make that decision when we’re deeper into winter and the energy crisis is really starting to become a bigger concern for growth.”

The U.S. Department of Energy is not considering tapping into its SPR “at this time”, nor is it pursuing a ban on oil exports, a Bloomberg News reporter said in a tweet. That was after a Financial Times report on Wednesday quoted Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who said that those options were on the table.

The United States has used its strategic reserves on occasion, usually after hurricanes or other supply disruptions. However, since ending a 40-year ban on crude exports in 2015, the nation has become a significant exporter, and has not broached cutting exports.

Goldman Sachs said a potential SPR release, which could be up to 60 million barrels, only posed a $3 downside risk to its $90l year-end Brent price forecast.

Early session losses were also an extension of Wednesday’s near 2% drop after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles and Russian assurances that it would boost gas supplies to Europe in response to the energy crunch and stands ready to stabilise the market..

Earlier this week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) agreed to only gradually raise output, sending crude prices to multi-year highs.

Oil markets have been on a steady rise due to tight supplies worldwide as demand recovered more quickly than expected from the pandemic in big import markets like China.

In addition, major producers and the International Energy Agency believe crude demand could rise by anywhere from 150,000 to 500,000 barrels per day in coming months as users of natural gas switch to oil due to high gas prices."

CALGARY – Canadians are being hit with all-time record gasoline prices heading into the Thanksgiving long weekend.

Federal government data shows the average national retail price for regular gasoline in Canada hit $1.45 per litre this week.

Fuel price consultancy firm Kalibrate, which has data all the way back to 2007, says these prices are record highs.

Some markets have seen double-digit week-over-week price increases. Drivers in the Manitoba cities of Brandon and Winnipeg saw the price at the pump go up by more than 11 cents per litre in the last week alone.

Overall, Canadian fuel prices are more than 40 cents per litre higher than they were last year.

Crude oil prices are at seven-year highs, which is the main factor behind higher gasoline costs. Higher carbon taxes are also reflected in retail gasoline prices."
[],10/7/2021,"











Oil prices dropped for a second session on Thursday, under pressure from an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks that raised concerns over demand after prices rallied to multi-year highs.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil slid 0.37%, or 28 cents, to $76.62 a barrel, after the market climbed on Wednesday to $79.78, the highest since November 2014.

Brent crude lost 0.49%, or 40 cents, to $80.39 a barrel.

“Commercial stockpiles of crude rose… last week, according to EIA data,” ANZ said in a note. “Stockpiles of gasoline also surged, raising concerns of weaker demand.”

U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.3 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, against expectations for a modest dip of 418,000 barrels. Gasoline inventories also rose, while distillate inventories were down slightly.

Global oil prices have jumped more than 50% this year, adding to inflationary pressure that could slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and impact consumer demand. Natural gas and coal prices have also climbed.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) said on Monday it would stick to its pact for a gradual increase in oil output, sending crude prices to multi-year highs.

“The producer group’s statement that its approach should reduce market volatility contrasts with the higher volatility that comes with tighter markets, especially when inventories are historically low,” analysts from Citi said in a note.

“Near-term, oil price movements look skewed to the upside, given growing market tightness with higher Chinese buying and incremental oil demand from the critically tight gas market for the power sector.”

OPEC+’s decision to raise oil output modestly and gradually, despite this year’s surge in prices, was partly driven by concern that demand and prices could weaken, sources close to the group told Reuters."

The last WotW focused on CBM, a shallow low pressure, dry gas play in the midst of well-developed infrastructure. Now we hop way up north to the Horn River Basin and have a look at the Evie – Otter Park – Muskwa (frequently referred to as the Horn River) play.

This is the ninth post in a series detailing how resource plays (basin-wide plays where hydrocarbons are the continuous phase) have often driven the Canadian oil and gas industry throughout its history. Links to the previous posts are provided at the bottom of this article.

Resource Play: Evie – Otter Park – Muskwa

Type Well: 200/c-024-D/094-O-09/00

Drilling/Completion Technology: Rotary/Horizontal/Multi-stage Hydraulically Fractured

Regional Geology

Unlike many Resource Plays for which the term “shale gas” is a misnomer, for the Horn River this is a very apt description. The Horn River Basin covers an area of over 1.1 million hectares, and the targeted formation trio of Evie, Otter Park and Muskwa can range from 140 to close to 300 metres in thickness. With 1.1 Tcf of recoverable raw gas reserves, the Horn River represents over a quarter of BC’s remaining reserves.

The wellbore display for 200/b-077-H/094-O-08/00 illustrates the nature of the Horn River strata. Details on the organic geochemistry and lithology may be found in Barker (2014).

As with all resource plays, understanding geomechanics is critical to successful development. While the dipmeter interpretation doesn’t reveal much structure in the way of bedding, a look at the high-quality image log reveals a well-developed natural fracture set dipping steeply to the East and present in all three target formations.

The entire image log is available to Petro Ninja subscribers by selecting 26936_WL_2011SEP25_BOREHOLE IMAGED INTERP.PDF.

Production

The Horn River features some very impressive wells, evidence of which is given by the 200-c-024-D/094-O-09-00 production forecast which predicts an EUR of over 33 bcf. Low decline. Minimal water. Over-pressured. Looks like we have another resource play!

Current drilling is sufficient to outline the potential of the Horn River. An active LNG project is the likely key to full development of this resource.

Another impediment to further development is the relatively high concentration of acid gas (CO2 ~ 13%).

This high CO2 is a result of significant over-maturation of the kerogens brought on by the high geothermal gradients in the region.

Developing a plan to deal with this greenhouse gas will be necessary to fully realize the potential of the Horn River. But these enhancements proceed alongside the buildout of LNG facilities. The future is yet to come for the Horn River.

To recap the discovery timeline to date, the Horn River is yet another significant resource play driver for the industry. Perhaps the non-resource plays are the ones that should be called “unconventional.”

LNG Tanker

Some of the world’s biggest importers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are reducing orders in the face of a 500% price surge within a year, raising concerns among major producers about potential long-term destruction of demand.

LNG buyers, including numerous emerging economies in Asia, are balking at prices that have doubled just within the past month, while a growing number of exporters in North America are straining to boost export capacity that will still take years to come online.

Natural gas is viewed as a more acceptable fossil fuel as growing economies like India, China and Pakistan try to reduce carbon emissions, because it burns more cleanly than oil and coal. But the surge in natural gas prices is prompting power providers to revert to coal and fuel oil and causing a rethink on new LNG investments in Southeast Asia, which was expected to be the heart of LNG demand growth.

Within Asia, which accounts for 70% of global LNG imports, a majority of long-term contracts are oil-linked. But South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh – which together account for 20% of Asia’s imports – have a much higher exposure to spot LNG prices, which are currently at a record high of over $50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

That’s raised alarm among developers in Southeast Asia, as analysts say plans for new LNG regasification terminals may now be delayed given the high LNG prices and after government budgets were stretched by costly COVID-19 outbreaks, a source familiar with contract negotiations said.

“New buyers are under a lot of pressure to justify signing contracts at these prices, so they have been slow to progress discussions,” said the source, who has noted a sharp fall in enthusiasm among potential buyers to even discuss LNG projects compared to a year ago. He declined to provide more details or be named due to the sensitive nature of the deals.

For big U.S. export terminal operators, rising prices were initially welcome. However, the volatility in costs makes it harder to sign additional long-term contracts and is a source of frustration, as they know that they will only be able to add incremental export capacity in the next year.

“We didn’t like the low and flat prices everywhere in the world of around $2 per mmBtu from a year ago, and I’m not sure what I dislike more with the very elevated prices we find ourselves in now,” said Anatol Feygin, chief commercial officer at Cheniere Energy Inc’s, the largest LNG exporter in the United States. “It is a manifestation of the markets not being very good at investing through the cycle.”

Feygin however said Cheniere would soon decide on an additional expansion at its Corpus Christi LNG export plant in Texas, noting that global prices, when compared with lower U.S. prices, are a tailwind for the company.

U.S. benchmark gas prices are currently at seven-year highs, but at $6 per million British thermal units, are far from Asian and European levels. The United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas into LNG – about 10% of the gas it pulls out of the ground.

Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States, when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere’s Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.

After that, the world may have to wait even longer for additional U.S. or Canadian projects. Houston-based Tellurian Inc, which announced three long-term deals over the summer to sell LNG to units of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Vitol SA and Gunvor Group, is expected to start producing LNG in late 2025 at the earliest, said Charif Souki, executive chairman.

In British Columbia, LNG Canada is not expected to go into service until around 2025. In addition, numerous proposed projects were scuttled between 2019 and 2020 due to persistently low prices.

LACK OF INVESTMENT

Asia’s newer buyers of LNG are more affected by price volatility than established importers, who are able to blunt the impact of higher spot prices by pooling those purchases with existing lower cost oil-linked deliveries, said Wood Mackenzie vice president Valery Chow.

“Rising LNG import bills are putting a severe strain on national budgets and (Bangladesh and Pakistan) are actively looking to switch away from gas in favour of lower cost alternatives, like fuel oil, for power generation,” Chow said.

Bangladesh has cut back on LNG imports, with September’s total dropping by 33% from the month before, Refinitiv Eikon shiptracking data showed. The country is also considering extending the leases of five oil-fired power plants and potentially increasing fuel oil imports.

Pakistan has been cancelling and re-issuing LNG tenders the past two months, and may consider relying on just term imports going forward, an industry source said.

There are signs of demand erosion in established buyers India and China. LNG imports into India are down 4.2% through September compared to the same period in 2020. In China, second-tier gas importers – mostly city-gas firms – are scaling back spot purchases.

In South Korea, Asia’s third largest importer, one buyer described the situation as “chaos”.

“The current market situation is not healthy to be in,” said Qatar’s Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi on the sidelines of a virtual LNG conference in Japan. The country is the world’s largest LNG supplier, and has said it will boost output by about 40% to 110 million tonnes per annum by 2026.

If LNG prices extend their recent run up, cost-conscious buyers may have no choice but to pare back demand.

Likewise, the words “we”, “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. “Subsidiaries”, “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”, respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.

Alternative Performance (non-GAAP) Measures

This announcement includes certain measures that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS, including Adjusted Earnings, “Adjusted EBITDA”, Cash flow from operating activities excluding working capital movements, Cash capital expenditure, Net debt and Underlying opex.

Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are measures used to evaluate Shell’s performance in the period and over time.

The “Adjusted Earnings” and Adjusted EBITDA are measures which aim to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell’s financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items.

Adjusted Earnings is defined as income/(loss) attributable to shareholders adjusted for the current cost of supplies and excluding identified items. “Adjusted EBITDA (CCS basis)” is defined as “Income/(loss) for the period” adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense. All items include the non-controlling interest component.

Cash flow from operating activities excluding working capital movements is a measure used by Shell to analyse its operating cash generation over time excluding the timing effects of changes in inventories and operating receivables and payables from period to period. Working capital movements are defined as the sum of the following items in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: (i) (increase)/decrease in inventories, (ii) (increase)/decrease in current receivables, and (iii) increase/(decrease) in current payables. Cash capital expenditure is the sum of the following lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash flows: Capital expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and Investments in equity securities. Net debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. Underlying operating expenses is a measure of Shell’s cost management performance and aimed at facilitating a comparative understanding of performance from period to period by removing the effects of identified items, which, either individually or collectively, can cause volatility, in some cases driven by external factors. Underlying operating expenses comprises the following items from the Consolidated statement of Income: production and manufacturing expenses; selling, distribution and administrative expenses; and research and development expenses and removes the effects of identified items such as redundancy and restructuring charges or reversals, provisions or reversals and others.We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile the above Non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is dependent on future events, some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods, which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are estimated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.

Railcars holding crude oil

Canadian heavy crude’s discount to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) widened slightly on Wednesday.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for November delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, settled at $12.70 per barrel below the WTI benchmark, according to NE2 Canada Inc, compared with Tuesday’s settlement of $12.60 a barrel below the benchmark.

The discount on heavy crude has been inching wider since the start of this month’s trade cycle, retreating from recent five-month highs hit in anticipation of Enbridge Inc bringing its Line 3 replacement project into service.

Linefill on Line 3 started on Friday.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for November delivery settled at 70 cents a barrel below U.S. benchmark crude, widening from Tuesday’s settle of 15 cents per barrel under the WTI benchmark.

Global oil prices dropped nearly 2%, pulling back from multi-year highs, as an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories prompted buyers to take a breather after recent torrid gains."
[],10/6/2021,"DENVER – Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE: OVV) (TSX: OVV) today announced the achievement of several sustainability milestones related to emissions reductions, social responsibility and corporate governance. In addition, the Company has launched a new dynamic sustainability website, highlighting Ovintiv’s data-driven approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance matters.

“Ovintiv is at the forefront of driving innovation to both profitably and sustainably produce oil and gas,” said Ovintiv President and CEO Brendan McCracken. “We are proud to provide the energy the world needs to make modern life possible. Innovating in pursuit of efficiency is what we do best, and that includes continuously improving our environmental, social and governance performance. We are committed to conducting our business in a manner that is ethically, environmentally and socially responsible; an approach which we believe delivers strong financial performance to our shareholders and responsibly-sourced and affordable energy to consumers today and into the future.”

Key highlights of Ovintiv’s recent sustainability achievements:

Delivering on 33% methane intensity reduction target in 2021, four years ahead of schedule

Expect to achieve greater than 20% reduction in scope 1&2 greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity by year end 2021 compared to 2019

Committed to establishing a Scope 1&2 GHG emission intensity target tied to 2022 compensation

As of September 1, 2021 , the company is fully aligned with the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, nine years ahead of the World Bank’s target

, the company is fully aligned with the World Bank initiative, nine years ahead of the World Bank’s target Established real-time emissions dashboard across all operations

Achieved 7th consecutive safest year ever in 2020 with a Total Recordable Injury Frequency of 0.19

Established a social commitment leadership team and published inaugural social commitment framework

Broadened the diversity of the Company’s Board of Directors

Said Ovintiv Board Chair, Peter Dea, “We believe that trust starts with transparency, which is why we strive to be a leader in ESG disclosure, having published a sustainability report and ESG performance metrics data since 2005. We value honest dialogue with our stakeholders about key issues and we value making measurable progress on multiple fronts.”

Emissions Reductions

The Company works continuously to reduce the environmental impact of its operations and in 2020 significantly reduced flaring and venting of natural gas across its operations. Ovintiv announced today that it expects to achieve its goal of reducing methane emissions intensity by 33% in 2021 – four years earlier than originally targeted. The Company expects its 2021 methane intensity to be below 0.10 metric tons of methane per thousand barrels of oil equivalent (CH4/MBOE). The target is benchmarked against the Company’s 2019 methane intensity of 0.15 metric tons of CH4/MBOE.

In addition, Ovintiv has declared full alignment with the World Bank Routine Flaring Initiative. Ovintiv does not engage in routine flaring by ensuring that natural gas gathering infrastructure is in place for all wells drilled. In 2020, flared and vented natural gas volumes accounted for less than 0.7% of total natural gas sales volumes, down significantly from approximately 1.2% in 2019. The reductions in flaring have continued with year-to-date 2021 flaring and venting at 0.4% of total natural gas sales volumes, representing a reduction of 67% from 2019.The Company has also been working closely with third party midstream providers to reduce emissions.

In 2021, Ovintiv expects to reduce its scope 1&2 GHG emissions intensity by greater than 20% compared to 2019 levels. In 2022, the company plans to further formalize its commitment to emissions reductions by setting a GHG emissions intensity target which will be tied to compensation for all employees.

Ovintiv has adopted—and continues to adopt—a range of strategies to help reduce emissions from its operations. These best practices include innovative techniques, efficiencies and proven technology, including:

Established a real-time dashboard to monitor emissions performance data and drive further improvements

On-going, comprehensive Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program

Electrification of operations proximal to existing, reliable electricity infrastructure and supply

Adoption of bi-fuel (natural gas and diesel) technology in drilling and completions operations to reduce emissions and costs

Automated gas lift optimization processes to enhance production and reduce well downtime

Repair and/or replacement of high-bleed pneumatic devices with low-bleed alternatives

Social Commitment

Underpinning Ovintiv’s social commitment is an ongoing focus on protecting the health and safety of its workforce. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, the Company reported its seventh consecutive safest year ever in 2020, with total recordable incident frequency (TRIF) for both employees and contractors dropping to 0.19 events times 200,000 per total exposure hours.

In late 2020, Ovintiv launched a social commitment leadership team to develop a new social commitment framework for the organization. Data and feedback were gathered from internal and external subject matter experts, community representatives and trade organizations, as well as Ovintiv’s executive leadership team. The resulting framework is rooted in the Company’s foundational values of Trust, Respect, Integrity, Safety and Sustainability. It focuses on three key accountabilities: respecting stakeholders, strengthening communities, and fostering a culture of inclusion.

Ovintiv values and is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company’s corporate governance framework has been revised to further reflect Ovintiv’s commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace. The Company has offered staff training on unconscious bias, formed an employee resource group to encourage inclusion and networking, conducted staff surveys on inclusion and facilitated sessions with guest speakers on diversity, equity and inclusion at work.

Ovintiv has an active, engaged and independent Board that is diverse by gender, ethnicity, skills and experiences. Since early 2019, the Company has deepened its board diversity, added five new directors, appointed a new independent board chairman and refreshed its committee memberships, including three new committee chairs. In February of 2021, the Board adopted a requirement that candidates of gender and racial or ethnic diversity are sought out and included in its Director search processes, commonly known as the “Rooney Rule”.

U.S. natural gas futures dropped over 10% on Wednesday after soaring to a 12-year high in the prior session as extreme volatility for energy prices around the world continues.

Analysts said U.S. futures rose on Tuesday as soaring global gas prices kept demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports high. They said it dropped on Wednesday as the market shifted focus back to the situation in the United States where output is growing and utilities likely added more gas than usual to stockpiles for a fourth week in a row last week.

Since the middle of August, global gas prices have repeatedly hit fresh record highs as Europe worries it may not have enough gas in storage for the winter and insatiable demand for the fuel in Asia caused utilities around the world to compete for available LNG cargoes.

Front-month gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 63.7 cents, or 10.1%, to settle at $5.675 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That was the biggest daily percentage drop since September 2020.

On Tuesday, the U.S. front-month closed up over 9% at its highest since December 2008.

“Price action today has been nearly the opposite of that of yesterday,” analysts at Gelber and Associates said in a report, noting “focus in the market has momentarily shifted back to domestic metrics, and… early expectations for a bearish storage report.”

Weeks of rapid changes in U.S. gas futures boosted implied volatility, used as a determinant of an option’s premium, to an all-time high on Tuesday.

Analysts have said gas stockpiles in some European countries were more than 20% below normal for this time of year. In the United States, meanwhile, inventories were expected to reach about 3.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) by the end of October. Analysts said that should be enough for the U.S. winter heating season even though that amount would fall short of the 3.7 tcf five-year (2016-2020) average for that time of year.

Belief that the United States will have enough gas in storage for this winter and a lack of capacity to produce more LNG for export has kept U.S. prices from rocketing to the record levels seen in Europe and Asia. However, pipeline constraints and competition for expensive LNG were expected to boost prices to multi-year highs in California and New England this winter.

Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to an average of 91.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in October from 91.1 bcfd in September. That compares with a monthly record of 95.4 bcfd in November 2019.

With gas prices at or near record highs of $46 per mmBtu in Europe and $35 in Asia, versus just over $6 in the United States, traders said buyers around the world would keep purchasing all the LNG the United States could produce.

Data provider Refinitiv said the amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slipped from an average of 10.4 bcfd in September to 10.0 bcfd so far in October with short-term upsets at a few Gulf Coast plants and Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland expected to remain shut for another week of planned maintenance.

But no matter how high global prices rise, the United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcfd of gas into LNG. Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode."

Oil dropped on Wednesday after hitting a multi-year high above $83 a barrel, pressured by an American Petroleum Institute (API) report showing rising crude inventories in the United States and technical indicators suggesting prices have rallied too fast.

The latest surge in the price of crude was underpinned by the refusal of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to boost output faster and comes against a backdrop of concern about tight energy supply globally.

On Monday, OPEC, Russia and other allies, known as OPEC+, chose to stay with a plan to increase output gradually and not boost it further as the United States and other consumer nations have been urging.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate dropped $1.43, or 1.81% to $77.49.

Brent crude dropped $1.38, or 1.67% to $81.16.

“An energy crisis is unfolding with winter in the northern hemisphere still to begin, and sets the stage for even higher oil prices,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.

The price of Brent has surged more than 50% this year, adding to inflationary pressure that could slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Natural gas has surged to a record peak in Europe and coal prices from major exporters have also hit all-time highs.

Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA, said both crude contracts looked overbought based on a widely followed technical indicator, the relative strength index.

“That may signal some daily pullbacks this week but does not change the underlying bullish case for oil,” he said.

Some downward pressure came from the API’s figures showing signs of slowing fuel demand.

The industry group said U.S. crude inventories rose by 951,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 1, website Oilprice.com reported, and gasoline and distillate fuel inventories also climbed.

Attention will focus later on official inventory numbers due at 1430 GMT from the Energy Information Administration."
[],10/6/2021,"











How high are oil prices really and what signal are they currently sending to producers and consumers about the need for more output and lower fuel use?

The strength of a price signal depends on both the real level of prices adjusted for inflation and the rate of change compared with recent years.

In terms of the rate of change, prices are already sending a strong signal about the need to increase production and reduce consumption, as the recovery in demand has outstripped supply after last year’s coronavirus-induced slump.

Front-month Brent futures are currently trading at more than $82 per barrel, up from less than $38 at the end of the same month last year, one of the fastest price increases in percentage terms for three decades.

Rapid price escalation is characteristic of the first year of a cyclical upswing, when consumption bounces back and grows above-trend, while producers continue to withhold output, scarred by memories of the recent slump.

The turnaround from lower/falling prices to higher/rising ones sends a signal about the need for producers to switch from reducing to increasing output, and consumers to conserve fuel rather than be profligate.

But in terms of the level of prices, adjusted for inflation, the current signal to producers and consumers is so far weaker and more ambiguous.

Comparisons with oil prices during previous cycles are distorted by the impact of inflation, which has consistently eroded the value of the U.S. dollar and tended to raise oil futures prices over time.

The impact is relatively insignificant over periods of 2-3 years, small enough to be ignored, but becomes increasingly significant over 5-year to 20-year horizons.

The dollar has lost almost a quarter of its consumer purchasing power since oil prices peaked at more than $140 per barrel in 2008.

If record Brent prices in 2008 are restated at the purchasing power of the dollar in 2021, prices peaked at more than $180 per barrel.

EVALUATING REAL PRICES

Inflation-adjusted prices in the past were much higher than they sometimes appear in retrospect, and current prices are lower than they appear in long-term historical comparisons.

In real terms, front-month Brent prices are currently in the 72nd percentile for all months since 1990, but only the 50th percentile for all months since 2000, and the 56th percentile for all months since 2010.

There is no ideal timeframe over which to evaluate real prices.

Longer comparisons incorporate more cycles but contain older, less relevant data. Shorter time frames are more relevant but contain fewer cycles and may be more distorted by short periods of high or low prices.

In the oil market, 30-year comparisons are distorted by the lengthy period of very low prices in the 1990s, which proved unsustainable, and may not be relevant to decisions a quarter of a century later.

But shorter comparisons since 2000 or 2010 are dominated by the periods of very high prices in 2007-2008 and 2011-2014, which proved equally unsustainable, and may not be relevant to decisions in the 2020s.

The four decades from 1990 to 2030 contain several actual and prospective changes in both production and consumption regimes and behaviour, which makes historical comparisons difficult.

Significant changes include massive excess production capacity in the 1990s, the shale revolution from the early 2010s and the advent of electric vehicles to compete with oil in the 2020s.

However, examining the level of prices in all these time frames, the most conservative conclusion is that the level of real oil prices is currently average or moderately high.

Real prices are sending a signal to producers and consumers about the need for more output and more fuel conservation, but not yet a very strong one.

Further significant price rises may be needed to compel consumers to reduce oil use and switch to cheaper alternatives and encourage producers to boost output."

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release contains forward-looking information with respect to: the expected close of the Agreement on or before October 31, 2021; that the Weyburn Unit will remain a core, strategic asset within Whitecap’s portfolio following the completion of the GORR sale; that the Weyburn project will sequester 2 MT of carbon per year; the production decline rate of the Weyburn asset; our ability to generate significant free funds flow from the Weyburn asset; the underlying assumptions and the benefits to be derived therefrom from the Agreement; the Weyburn free funds flow break-even price; that we will reach our target net debt prior to year end; 2021 year end unutilized credit capacity and forecasted debt to EBITDA ratio at US$45/bbl WTI and US$70/bbl WTI; that Whitecap’s debt reduction plans will provide significant financial flexibility, optionality and long-term sustainability; plans to maintain balance sheet strength; and potential plans to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders through targeted share buybacks and dividend increases.

The forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by our management, including expectations and assumptions concerning prevailing commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates and tax laws; the impact (and the duration thereof) that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on (i) the demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, (ii) our supply chain, including our ability to obtain the equipment and services we require, and (iii) our ability to produce, transport and/or sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; future production rates and estimates of operating costs; performance of existing and future wells; reserve volumes; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in drilling new wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business; results of operations; performance; business prospects and opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; the impact of increasing competition; ability to efficiently integrate assets and employees acquired through acquisitions, ability to market oil and natural gas successfully and our ability to access capital.

Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Whitecap can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; pandemics and epidemics; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, production, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations; interest rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental risks; competition; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; reliance on third parties and pipeline systems; and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, production curtailment, royalties and environmental regulations. Our actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking information and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits that we will derive therefrom. Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in order to provide security holders with a more complete perspective on our future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.

Readers are cautioned that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive. Additional information on these and other factors that could affect our operations or financial results are included in reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website ( www.sedar.com ).

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by applicable securities laws.

This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, “FOFI”) about Whitecap’s 2021 year-end net debt; free funds flow,; liquidity of Whitecap’s credit facility and debt to EBITDA ratio, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. The actual results of operations of Whitecap and the resulting financial results will likely vary from the amounts set forth in this press release and such variation may be material. Whitecap and its management believe that the FOFI has been prepared on a reasonably basis, reflecting management’s best estimates and judgments. However, because this information is subjective and subject to numerous risks, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Whitecap undertakes no obligation to update such FOFI. FOFI contained in this press release was made as of the date of this press release and was provided for the purpose of providing further information about Whitecap’s anticipated future business operations. Readers are cautioned that the FOFI contained in this press release should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein.

Oil and Gas Advisories

References to crude oil or natural gas production in this press release refer to the light and medium crude oil and conventional natural gas, respectively, product types as defined in National Instrument 51-101, Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”).

“Boe” means barrel of oil equivalent based on 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Non-GAAP Measures

This press release includes non-GAAP measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS” or, alternatively, “GAAP”) and, therefore, may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. See the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operation for the period ended June 30, 2021 for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.

“Debt to EBITDA” is calculated in accordance with the Company’s credit agreements, copies of which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com).

“Free funds flow” represents funds flow less expenditures on property, plant and equipment. Management believes that free funds flow provides a useful measure of Whitecap’s ability to increase returns to shareholders and to grow the Company’s business. Previously, Whitecap also deducted dividends paid or declared in the calculation of free funds flow. The Company believes the change in presentation better allows comparison with both dividend paying and non-dividend paying peers."
[],10/5/2021,"This news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) that relate to the Company’s current expectations and views of future events. These forward-looking statements relate to future events or the Company’s future performance. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as “will likely result”, “are expected to”, “expects”, “will continue”, “is anticipated”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimated”, “intends”, “plans”, “forecast”, “projection”, “strategy”, “objective” and “outlook”) are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this news release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this news release. In particular and without limitation, this news release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to the following: Topaz’s future growth outlook and strategic plans; the anticipated capital expenditure plans and production increases relating to completed and planned acquisitions; the benefits to be derived from the Strategic Acquisitions, including ESG benefits; the timing for the completion of the Weyburn Royalty Acquisition; the geological characteristics of the Unit including the CCUS, reserve life index, GHG emissions intensity and capital efficiencies; the statements relating to the Equity Financing including the size of the Equity Financing, the use of proceeds under the Equity Financing, the expected participation of insiders in the concurrent private placement, the anticipated closing of the Equity Financing and concurrent private placement, the receipt of all regulatory approvals for the Equity Financing including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange; the environmental benefits associated with the Strategic Acquisitions; expected production increases and capital commitments on the royalty lands; estimated levels of EBITDA,(1) (including Estimated Annualized EBITDA) and free cash flow(1); the future dividend increase and declaration and payment of dividends and the timing and amount thereof; the information described under the heading “Estimated Annualized EBITDA NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE” below; other expected benefits from the Weyburn Royalty Acquisition and the Complementary Acquisitions including enhancing Topaz’s existing high-quality royalty portfolio and providing complementary low decline, reliable free cash flow generating assets; and the Company’s business as described under the heading “About the Company” above. Forward–looking information is based on a number of assumptions including those highlighted in this news release and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those that are disclosed in or implied by such forward–looking information.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the failure to complete acquisitions on the terms or on the timing announced or at all and the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions including estimated royalty production, royalty production revenue growth, and the factors discussed in the Company’s recently filed Management’s Discussion and Analysis (See “Forward-Looking Statements” therein), Annual Information Form (See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or Topaz’s website (www.topazenergy.ca).

Statements relating to “reserves” and “resources” are also deemed to be forward looking information, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves or resources can be profitably produced in the future.

Without limitation of the foregoing, future dividend payments, if any, and the level thereof is uncertain, as the Company’s dividend policy and the funds available for the payment of dividends from time to time is dependent upon, among other things, free cash flow,(1) financial requirements for the Company’s operations and the execution of its acquisition growth strategy, fluctuations in working capital and the timing and amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Further, the ability of Topaz to pay dividends will be subject to applicable laws (including the satisfaction of the solvency test contained in applicable corporate legislation) and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing its indebtedness, including its credit facility.

Topaz does not undertake any obligation to update such forward–looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to using financial measures prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS” or “GAAP”), references are made in this news release to the terms “EBITDA”, “cash flow”, “free cash flow,” and “free cash flow per share,” ” which are not recognized measures under GAAP, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Accordingly, the Company’s use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other companies.

Management uses the terms “EBITDA,” “cash flow”, “free cash flow,” and “free cash flow per share,” for its own performance measures and to provide shareholders and potential investors with a measurement of the Company’s efficiency and its ability to generate the cash necessary to fund dividends and a portion of its future growth expenditures or to repay debt. Accordingly, investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation nor as an alternative to net income (loss) or other financial information determined in accordance with GAAP as an indication of the Company’s performance.

For these purposes, “EBITDA” is net income or loss, excluding extraordinary items, plus interest expense, income taxes, and adjusted for non-cash items including depletion and depreciation and share-based compensation and gains or losses on dispositions. “Cash flow” is cash from (used in) operations before changes in non-cash working capital. “Free cash flow” is defined as cash flow less capital expenditures. “Free cash flow per share” is defined as free cash flow divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the respective period.

ESTIMATED ANNUALIZED EBITDA NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE

References are made in this news release to the term “Estimated Annualized EBITDA,” which is presented by management to estimate the financial impact attributed to the Strategic Acquisitions, before consideration of future development by Whitecap or the operators of the Complementary Acquisitions’ assets. This estimate is not a recognized measure under GAAP, and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Accordingly, the Company’s use of this term may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other companies.

“Estimated Annualized EBITDA” was calculated using management’s best estimate of the working interest production attributable to the Strategic Acquisitions (see “Supplemental Information Regarding Product Types“); the Company’s respective gross overriding royalty percentage attributable to the Weyburn Royalty Acquisition of 5% and the respective Complementary Acquisitions of 2% and 4%; and the most recent (September 2021) monthly commodity prices as follows: crude oil US$WTI $71.54; Western Canadian Select differential US$13.48; Mixed Sweet Blend (Edm) differential US$3.36; AECO natural gas C$3.73/mcf; and product quality differentials and transportation deductions consistent with historical realizations. “Estimated Annualized EBITDA” was calculated on a monthly basis; annualized by multiplying by 12.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOKS

Also included in this news release are estimates of Topaz’s 2021 Estimated Annualized EBITDA, which is based on, among other things, the various assumptions as to working interest production levels, capital expenditures, annual cash flows and other assumptions disclosed in this news release. To the extent such estimate constitutes a financial outlook, it was approved by management and the Board of Directors of Topaz on October 5, 2021 and are included to provide readers with an understanding of Topaz’s anticipated Estimated Annualized EBITDA based on the capital expenditure, production and other assumptions described herein and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCT TYPES

This news release includes references to the current production of the Strategic Acquisitions on a combined basis which is the average daily working interest production from each of the Weyburn Royalty Acquisition and the Complementary Royalty Acquisitions for the five days ending October 2, 2021. The following table is intended to provide supplemental information about the product type composition for the working interest production figure that is provided in this news release:

(1) Average daily working interest production for the month of May 2021 was 14,350 bbl/d (comprised of 13,973 bbl/d of crude oil and 377 bbl/d of NGLs) prior to downtime attributed to compressor maintenance activity which was completed on September 30, 2021; thereafter production returned to previous production rates. (2) Reflects recent drilling results but does not take into consideration future development anticipated by the assets’ operators pursuant to aggregate contractual capital development commitments of $70.0 million.

BOE EQUIVALENCY

Per barrel of oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6:1). Barrel of oil equivalents (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, as the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

OIL AND GAS METRICS

This news release contains certain oil and gas metrics which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons. Such metrics have been included in this document to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company’s performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the Company’s future performance and future performance may not compare to the Company’s performance in previous periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon.

Original oil in place (“OOIP”) means discovered petroleum initially in place (“DPIIP”). DPIIP is derived by Whitecap’s independent qualified reserve evaluators (“QRE”) and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluations Handbook (“COGEH”). DPIIP, as defined in COGEH, is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations prior to production. The recoverable portion of DPIIP includes production, reserves and resources other than reserves (ROTR). OOIP/DPIIP and potential recovery rate estimates are based on current recovery technologies. There is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate recoverability and commercial viability of any of the resource associated with OOIP/DPIIP, and as such a recovery project cannot be defined for a volume of OOIP/DPIIP at this time. All reserve and resource estimates contained in this news release have been prepared by McDaniel effective as of December 31, 2020.

Oil spills into ocean waters, subject to winds and tides and spreading swiftly over wide areas, are difficult to clean up.

The 3,000-barrel weekend spill off the coast of southern California is nowhere near as disastrous as mega-spills like the Deepwater Horizon explosion that sent millions of barrels of oil into U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico. But swift movement of the liquids can kill wildlife and foul beaches before cleanup teams are deployed. Federal and state responders begin fighting oil spills by deploying diving teams, and they use tools like containment booms: floating barriers that help contain the spread of spills far offshore, keeping much of the oil from reaching the coastline. Still, this weekend’s spill had spread over a number of miles in the Pacific Ocean.

“As the oil continues to move, the (cleanup) area expands, and it’s going to be a sustained effort,” said U.S. Coast Guard Public Affairs Officer Jeannine Shaye, at a Monday press conference. “We have 14 vessels on the water hired by oil spill response organizations.”

Containment booms generally contain as much crude as possible using a skirt that hangs down into the water, weighed down by a chain or cable.

Booms also use a “freeboard,” a firm piece above the waterline to keep oil from splashing outside the containment area. However, booms can be less effective if storms or high waves crest the top of the equipment.

Residents of Orange County, California, said they saw tar-like balls wash up on the beach. In some cases, dispersant chemicals are used to break up clumps of oil, particularly when a spill is farther offshore and difficult to contain, as was seen in the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010.

Since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has developed two new repositories of data to better detect oil spills and other pollution events, as well as where spills are moving.

For recovering from a large, contained oil slick, responders can use a specialized ship that pulls alongside the containment area, trapping crude and then pumping it into tanks aboard.

Recovery crews can also rely upon remote-operated skimmers, which scoop the oil from above, then contain it. Skimmers operate best in calm waters, and can also remove more water than oil, according to the EPA.

Sorbents, a type of pad that can absorb crude oil, are often deployed when thicker grades of crude need to be absorbed. Sorbents are less effective at collecting lighter types of crude oil."
