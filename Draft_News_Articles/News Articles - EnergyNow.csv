– Past Workforce Forward Speaker

HR resource professionals and businesses challenged by Workforce Forward’s Leadership Council to be more culturally safe and more representative of an Indigenous workforce.

(Oct 12, 2021, Calgary Alberta) — Less than one-quarter (22%) of Western Canadian organizations currently have an Indigenous strategy for recruitment, and only one-in-ten (9%) are currently developing one. – CPHR Alberta HR Trends Report. April 2019.

Workforce Forward, a summit being held this year virtually on Nov 30, 2021 – aimed at HR professionals and businesses across Canada looking to build or improve their Indigenous inclusion strategy for recruitment, training and retention – is set to improve the statistics with a series of conferences that will bridge the indubitable gap in Canada’s workforce.

“I’m a content creator for HR professionals on issues that matter to them. I wasn’t surprised at the lack of knowledge our industry has on Indigenous workforce inclusion strategies. I was surprised (and impressed) however with the surmountable desire to learn, get informed and make change to be more inclusive.” Andrea Adams, HR Influencer & Producer of HR Shop Talk.

Industry thought leaders have been carefully selected by the Workforce Forward Leadership Council to take part in the panels and workshops for those in the beginning stages of their strategies to those who are in the advanced stages – ensuring the commitment to continuous learning for all levels is available. See full list of speakers and topics here: https://workforceforward.ca/ 2021-agenda/

“There is a trend and a movement in this space to do better and Workforce Forward meets a need for those looking to improve on existing strategies or make a change to include one. Due to the pandemic, this in person event was changed to be held virtually last June and now will continue as a series on Nov 30, 2011– the fourth event of its kind so far to take place in a series of many to come. The work on truth and reconciliation doesn’t stop because we are dealing with a pandemic crisis. It most certainly changed how we do things and the priority on this did not stall for many companies. Organizations have used this time to work on corporate inclusiveness and are showing a more genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion – so much so that we’ve seen a movement with companies that now mandate it as a metric for their bottom line,” says Katie Comb, Co-Founder and Event Producer at the Connect Partnership Group – Workforce Forward.

What are Workforce Forward workshop/panel speakers saying about Indigenous Employees & working with Indigenous Communities?

I’ve learned that in any Indigenous Inclusion activity, early and active listening to the Indigenous perspective is critical to success, which ultimately leads to greater respect, understanding and meaningful connections – Scot Durward, Manager, Operations and Woodlands Human Resources – TOLKO Industries

“My piece of advice for those looking to be more diverse and inclusive is very simple: Approach community [and Indigenous Employees] with genuine interest and an open mind. Indigenous people are naturally relational, so building respectful relationships is key. Every community has a champion working for the betterment of community by making connections with industry. Find this person and listen to what the community’s needs are. Every community is not the same and each will have their own aspirations for their people.” Kirsten Ryder, Director Training & Development, Stoney Tribal Administration

“Working with Indigenous communities requires respectful, meaningful dialogue in order to form genuine, beneficial relationships. Take the time to learn about Indigenous history, and the Calls to Action outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as this will form the foundation for a mutually beneficial and trusting relationship” Tim Laronde , National Director, Indigenous Strategies, Chandos Construction, Mississauga

[],10/12/2021,"The St. Louis-based natural gas company Spire Inc. is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to keep operating a pipeline through Illinois and Missouri, warning that a winter shutdown could be devastating to St. Louis-area customers.

In a filing last week, Spire requested a stay that would allow operation of its Spire STL Pipeline until the issue is resolved in the courts. If the Supreme Court declines to take up the case, operation of the pipeline could cease on Dec. 13 unless the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission extends an emergency order granted in September.

Spire's court filing said shutting down the pipeline “in the middle of winter could result in the loss of natural-gas service to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses"" in the St. Louis region.

“With winter heating season less than one month away, customers who rely on the STL Pipeline need assurance that this critical infrastructure will continue to deliver a reliable and affordable energy supply,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

But the Environmental Defense Fund's lead counsel, Natalie Karas, said the stay is unnecessary because Spire already has approval through mid-December ""and FERC is poised to issue another temporary certificate to keep the pipeline operational through the winter to ensure reliable service to St. Louis customers.”

The pipeline runs for 65 miles (105 kilometers), from Scott County, Illinois, to near St. Louis, where it connects with a national network. FERC granted approval in 2018.

Spire has called it vital for providing “reliable and critical energy access to 650,000 homes and businesses throughout the St. Louis region.” But the EDF contended in a lawsuit that the pipeline harms land in its path, and that taxpayers will foot the bill for decades to come.

In June, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that FERC “failed to adequately balance public benefits and adverse impacts” in approving the pipeline. The panel also wrote that evidence showed the pipeline “is not being built to serve increasing load demand and that there is no indication the new pipeline will lead to cost savings.”

The ruling vacated approval of the pipeline, prompting FERC's 90-day order allowing its continued operation.

Spire cited a severe cold spell last winter as evidence of the pipeline's value. While other areas struggled with lack of supply and high natural gas costs in February, “the STL Pipeline ensured the St. Louis region had access to reliable, affordable energy, when it needed it most,"" the company said in a statement.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 11, 2021 /CNW/ – Methane is responsible for around 30 percent of the global rise in temperatures to date and half a million premature deaths globally each year. It also accounts for about 13 percent of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Slashing emissions from methane is one of the fastest and lowest cost ways to fight climate change and is one of the top recommendations made by climate scientists in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

During today’s Global Methane Pledge Ministerial Meeting, co-chaired by the United States and the European Union, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced Canada’s support for the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to reduce global methane emissions by 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. In support of the Pledge and the goals in Canada’s climate plan, Minister Wilkinson also announced Canada’s commitment to developing a plan to reduce methane emissions across the broader Canadian economy and to reducing oil and gas methane emissions by at least 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030. Canada is the first and only country to support the Pledge and the 75 percent goal, and our approach will include regulations. Moving forward, Canada will mobilize and work with the energy sector, provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, and other stakeholders in developing our approach.

The International Energy Agency has made it clear that curbing methane emissions from oil and gas operations represents one of the best near-term opportunities for limiting the worst impacts of climate change and has called on countries and companies to reduce methane emissions from the sector by 75% below 2012 levels by 2030. At the Meeting, the Minister noted the importance of the 75% goal and called on other oil-producing nations to join Canada in adopting it.

The commitments announced today build on Canada’s existing actions to curb methane emissions. In 2016, Canada set a target of reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40–45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025 and has put in place regulations to help achieve it, making it one of the first countries in the world to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector at the national level. Achieving this 2025 goal is an important part of the Government’s efforts to meet its new Nationally Determined Contribution of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40–45 percent by 2030. Last year, the Government also launched the Emissions Reduction Fund, which will, in part, achieve methane reductions beyond those prescribed in the federal regulations.

Globally, agriculture and landfills are among the largest sources of methane emissions. The 2030 objective in the Pledge is expected to help prevent over 20 million tonnes of crop losses a year by 2030 by reducing ground-level ozone pollution, caused in part by methane. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadian farmers and industry partners who are taking action to reduce emissions, sequester carbon and make their operations more sustainable, productive and competitive. This includes through investments in new programs, such as the Agricultural Climate Solutions initiative and the Agricultural Clean Technology Program, which aim to help farmers adopt new, beneficial management practices and clean technologies to boost productivity and lower emissions—including from methane. The Government is also committed to developing an approach to increase the number of landfills that collect and treat methane, and ensure existing systems capture as many methane emissions as possible.

Internationally, Canada has played a leading role and is an active participant in global initiatives to reduce methane emissions, including as Chair of the Global Methane Initiative, and as a founding partner in the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and the Arctic Council. Moving forward, Canada will work with the United States, the European Union, and other early supporters of the Global Methane Pledge to encourage additional countries to support the Pledge and commit to ambitious action on methane. The Government will also continue to encourage other oil-producing nations to commit to its 2030 goal of reducing methane emissions from oil and gas by 75 percent below 2012 levels, and will work with partners to deliver on its existing and new commitments to slash methane emissions and fight climate change.

Quotes

“This is a critical year for climate action and Canada is proud to be among the early supporters of the Global Methane Pledge, a critical initiative that will increase global action to fight climate change. Climate change is accelerating, and Canadians expect ambitious action to address it. That means doing the hard work at home to set ambitious goals and develop concrete plans to get there. It also means working with international partners to increase the scope and scale of climate action around the world. Today’s announcement, coupled with Canada’s existing efforts to slash methane emissions and fight climate change, will bring us another step closer to securing a healthier planet and economy for decades to come.”

– The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

“Combatting climate change means tackling methane, and that’s what the Global Methane Pledge does. Canada’s oil and gas workers have the skills, ingenuity and determination to get it done, so we’re working with the provinces and territories to put those workers front and centre. They’re the ones who’ll get the job done.”

– The Honourable Seamus O’Regan Jr., Minister of Natural Resources

“A healthy environment goes hand-in-hand with a sustainable agriculture sector that continues to provide good jobs and healthy food for Canadians. Canada’s farmers and ranchers are good stewards of the land, and have made significant progress increasing production while lowering methane emissions. Our government will continue to help farmers adopt agricultural management practices and clean technologies to support sustainability and reduce emissions.”

– The Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food

Quick facts

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and short-lived climate pollutant that has eighty–six times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a twenty-year period after being released into the atmosphere.

According to the Global Methane Assessment from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and the United Nations Environment Programme, reducing methane emissions by 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030 can prevent over 200,000 premature deaths, hundreds of thousands of asthma-related emergency room visits, and over 20 million tonnes of crop losses a year by 2030 by reducing ground-level ozone pollution caused in part by methane.

Methane accounts for 17 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, principally from the energy, agriculture, and waste sectors.

The Global Methane Pledge is an initiative to reduce global methane emissions that will be launched at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow.

On October 7, 2021, the International Energy Agency released a report on the need for countries and companies to commit to reducing methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030. The International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, released earlier this year, also envisions the 75 percent reduction. Canada is the first and only country to support the Global Methane Pledge and the 75 percent goal.

[],10/12/2021,"The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada (PetroLMI) released its latest report, Workforce Impacts from Alberta Well Closures: Creating Stability Through Cyclicality , which provides insights into the workforce opportunities and challenges presented by the Alberta Site Rehabilitation Program (SRP) and other financial incentive programs.

The report is the first of its kind to provide an overview of the well closure activities related to inactive and orphaned wells, the key well servicing and environmental occupations involved, and the labour and demand gaps. The report also explores the topics of Indigenous participation and repurposing dormant infrastructure to develop renewable energies, as well as recommendations from early lessons learned from the implementation of these programs.

“Developing oil and natural gas resources involves a series of activities and doesn’t simply end once the resources are produced. An important part of the process is decommissioning the well and bringing the surrounding land back to its original state,” says Carol Howes, Vice President of Communications and PetroLMI, Energy Safety Canada. “This report dives into these closure and environmental activities, and as importantly, looks at the kind of skilled workforce required to get the work done.

There are approximately 105,000 inactive and orphan wells across Alberta, and increased closure activity due to the SRP and other financial incentives has helped to create or sustain thousands of jobs across the province, while at the same time contributing to responsible resource development. Improved commodity prices and increased activity, as well as the financial incentive programs seem to be stabilizing employment. The unemployment rate in the oil and gas services sub-sector decreased from 22.5 per cent in July 2020 to 4.1 per cent in July 2021.

Oil and gas services companies are reporting a shortage of new and experienced workers and are finding it difficult to attract workers back to the industry after a six-year economic downturn. Many of the same oil and gas services companies conduct well closure activities as well as activities supporting exploration and production.

“In a recent survey, over 50 per cent of our members reported difficulty in finding qualified and experienced workers,” says Elizabeth Aquin, Senior Vice President, Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC). “With fewer people applying and expectations of activity this fall and winter, project delays and increased costs for labour may result. The career opportunities are as diverse as the services our members provide and growing in this innovative sector. PSAC is looking at a variety of ways to support members in attracting the workforce they need.”

The report Workforce Impacts from Alberta Well Closures: Creating Stability Through Cyclicality was funded by the Province of Alberta working in partnership with the Government of Canada to provide employment support programs and services.

The Petroleum Labour Market Information (PetroLMI) Division of Energy Safety Canada is a leading resource for labour market information and trends in Canada’s energy industry. PetroLMI specializes in providing oil and gas labour market data and insights, as well as resources for workforce and career planning.

The mismatch in demand and supply could quickly drain inventories. The gap between West Texas Intermediate’s two nearest contracts has widened in recent days in an indication that stockpiles at the key U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, are set to shrink.

Global inventories may dwindle to their lowest level on record in terms of days-of-cover by the end of this year, Citigroup Inc. said Monday, when it increased its fourth-quarter Brent forecast to $85 a barrel and said it may touch $90 at times. UBS Group AG raised its forecast for both New York and London oil because of stronger demand from the power sector and reviving U.S. jet fuel consumption.

“Gas-to-oil switching and the potential for a colder winter in the northern hemisphere will underpin the demand front,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

Prices: WTI for November delivery rose 0.2% to $80.69 a barrel as of 10:56 a.m. in London The contract was 61 cents higher than the December settlement, up from 29 cents at the start of last week, indicating a tightening market

Brent for December advanced 0.2% to $83.83

The revival in demand comes after last year’s record slump as the pandemic ravaged the world. The improving metrics are also evident in long-suffering refining profits.

In Europe, margins have climbed from “essentially zero in June” to near pre-pandemic levels, partially driven by stronger demand for diesel and jet-type fuels, Citi said in a separate report. In Singapore, complex margins have risen to the highest in two years, while those for diesel are near a 21-month high.

Still, the pace of oil’s surge, combined with surging prices of other energy commodities and metals is bringing on inflation and threatening to hit economies reviving from the pandemic slump. Industries in Europe are being forced to crimp or shut operations. That, in turn, could weigh on oil demand."
[],10/12/2021,"MELBOURNE, Oct 12 (Reuters) – Global plans to build carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants have mushroomed over the last nine months as governments and companies accelerate the hunt for ways to cut emissions and curb global warming by mid-century , a think tank said on Tuesday.

The capacity of planned projects soared to 111 million tonnes a year (mtpa) as of end-September, up 52% from 73 mtpa at the end of 2020, the Melbourne-based Global CCS Institute said in an annual status report. If built, those projects would nearly treble the 40 mtpa of CCS capacity now operating.

While there was more capacity on the drawing board than now a decade ago, high costs stopped most projects going ahead. Just last weekend, demolition began at a multi-billion dollar power plant in Mississippi where costs blew out so much that regulators stopped a CCS project.

But CCS costs have since fallen while the impetus for emissions cuts has grown, Global CCS Institute general manager Alex Zapantis said.

“The drivers have become much stronger from a business perspective. The costs are coming down,” said Zapantis.

“All of this is on the basis of rapidly rising expectations for stronger climate action by pretty much everyone. That’s why we’ll continue to see this rise in projects.”

Pipeline of CCS projects worldwide 2010 to 2021

Critics say CCS is a waste of money and will prolong the life of dirty fossil fuels, but advocates, including the International Energy Agency, see CCS as essential to help meet net zero emissions.

Planned capacity has grown the most in North America, partly due to tax credits for CCS. More than 40 projects have been announced this year, including Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM.N) huge Houston Ship Channel CCS concept.

In Europe, spurred by tough emissions targets and high carbon prices, there are 35 projects in development. The UK, Belgium and the Netherlands added 17 this year.

In the Asia Pacific region, projects in Indonesia and Malaysia tied to gas developments have been approved recently and Zapantis said more projects in the region are awaiting clarity on compliance regulations before going ahead.

The institute’s CCS projects report is typically compiled annually but was released earlier than normal to coincide with the COP26 United Nations climate talks due to take place in Glasgow this month.

The UN conference could boost the business case for CCS projects if governments agree to a framework that recognises and values CCS along with other sources of emissions reduction, Zapantis said."

Adding it all up, fossil fuel demand is already flirting with pre-pandemic levels, which means emissions are on the rise too. On current trends, the combined consumption of coal, natural gas and oil is likely to hit an all-time high by mid-2022.

“This is the revenge of the fossil fuels,” said Thierry Bros, an energy expert and professor at Sciences Po in Paris.

The situation points to a daunting new phase for the energy transition, with growing tensions among the disparate policy objectives of simultaneously reducing emissions, keeping prices low, and guaranteeing security of supply. The pace of the effort could even be at risk if soaring prices dent public support for climate policies.

It’s a dark backdrop just days ahead of the start of a United Nations summit in Glasgow, COP26, which many believe is the last opportunity to avert catastrophic climate change.

“The climate crisis is real, and energy transition is a necessity, and we must accelerate it — but it’s not a flick of a switch,” said Amos Hochstein, U.S.’s top energy diplomat. “If we want to solve climate change we need to do so while at the same time insulating the global economy from extreme energy shocks.”

Governments can’t ignore the price squeeze, and many have stepped in to cushion the impact with subsidies and tax cuts. But with constant warnings about irreparable damage to the planet, few see officials rolling back from their emissions commitments.

More than 70% of people around the world are worried that climate change will harm them personally at some point, according to the Pew Research Center. The figure is lower in the U.S., though still at 60%. In Germany, the Green party just had its best ever result in an election, and is likely to form part of the next government.

For several years, the world has grown complacent about fossil fuel consumption. From oil to coal, peak demand has been the buzzword, always about to happen, but never actually materializing. Then many assumed that some of the drop in consumption during the pandemic was structural, driven by social changes like work-from-home and the hope of a greener recovery.

But outside jet-fuel, still hamstrung by travel restrictions, oil demand is today higher than it was in 2019. The car has returned to city centers as people avoid public transport. Many countries are desperate for gas as it’s become the swing fuel that offsets the ups-and-downs of solar and wind in electricity generation. Coal is on the up too, even if the medium-term outlook for the dirtiest fossil fuels remains decidedly somber.

Under the short-term cyclical factors — the super-fast rebound and supply constraints — a bigger longer-trend is also shaping the market. As governments work to reduce emissions, investors are pulling out of dirty businesses, and companies are cutting spending and closing facilities. With cleaner energies not fully ready to take up the slack, that’s created an imbalance, as well as volatile prices.

“We’re at a fairly critical junction,” said Russell Hardy, the head of Vitol Group, the world’s largest independent oil trader. “The hydrocarbon industry is going to suffer a bit of under-investment as we go forward as people focus their capital on greener projects.’’

The market is already flashing red. The cost of coal has surged above $200 a tonne, surpassing the 2008 peak during the last commodity boom, and natural gas in Europe and Asia is at an all time high. U.K. benchmark electricity prices last month surged at one point to more than 400 pounds per megawatt hour, about 10 times normal, prompting West Burton A to come into action.

The demand surge has challenged many assumptions about how quickly the world would decabornize. Faced with an energy crisis, many consuming nations zoned in on older fuels. The White House urged the OPEC cartel to increase oil production fast, and the International Energy Agency asked Russia to pump more gas. China ordered banks to prioritize loans to coal miners to boost supplies.

“I’m concerned hydrocarbon demand is not falling fast enough to match the potential under investment in fossil fuels,” said Jason Bordoff, dean of the Columbia Climate School and a former senior energy official in the Obama administration.

Coal is paradigmatic. For nearly a decade, it appeared in terminal decline as investors shunned miners and European countries shut down coal-fired power plants.

And yet, the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel won’t go away. Global consumption peaked in 2014, but rather than fall rapidly, as many expected, it stabilized in a gentle plateau. And now, just as the fight against climate change intensifies, it’s growing again, with the resurgence largely driven by China.

Oil is another case where hopes of an early peak in demand are quickly fading. In 2020, Bernard Looney, the head of British oil giant BP Plc, said it was possible that Covid marked the moment of peak oil. That view has since shifted, with BP predicting in August that demand will reach pre-Covid levels in the second half of 2022.

All of this means carbon dioxide emissions are rising too. The IEA estimates that they’ll post their second largest annual increase ever this year, reversing most of the decline during the lockdowns of 2020. On current trends, emissions will hit a fresh record in 2022 despite all government pledges bring them down, and quickly.

According to the IEA, about $750 billion will be spent on clean energy and efficiency worldwide in 2021, “far below what is required” to meet decarbonization targets. Total energy investment, including green and fossil fuels sources, will hit $1.9 trillion.

As political leaders prepare for COP26, the energy price spike has polarized views about the green transition, already an enormous challenge that involves rewiring the whole global economy. Climate change deniers and fossil fuel industry lobbyist have seized on it to campaign against green energy. On the other side, some climate activists say it shows the need to go even faster.

“Inevitably, it wasn’t going to be a transition without tension,” said Morgan Bazilian, an energy expert and professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines. “The balancing act politically is becoming a lot harder.”"

Wholesale gas prices up 400% this year, power prices double

Rising wholesale energy costs are passed on to consumers

European households set to feel the pinch this winter

LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) – Households across Europe face much higher winter energy bills due to a global surge in wholesale power and gas prices and consumer groups have warned the most vulnerable in the region could be hit by fuel poverty as a result.

WHY THE HIGH PRICES?

Energy companies pay a wholesale price to buy gas and electricity, which they then sell to consumers. As in any market, this can go up or down, driven by supply and demand.

Prices typically rise in response to more demand for heating and people turning lights on earlier in winter, while those in the summer period are usually lower.

But prices have sky-rocketed due to low gas storage stocks, high European Union carbon prices, low liquefied natural gas tanker deliveries due to higher demand from Asia, less gas supplies from Russia than usual, low renewable output and infrastructure outages.

Benchmark European gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub have risen by more than 400% since January, while benchmark German and French power contracts have more than doubled.

HOW LONG COULD THIS LAST?

Europe’s winter heating season typically begins in October and wholesale prices are not forecast to fall significantly during the remainder of this year, despite promises from some suppliers of more gas.

Many analysts expect prices to remain elevated next year.

Russia, Europe’s largest gas supplier, said this week that the certification of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which expects clearance from a German regulator, could cool soaring European gas prices. read more

The regulator, which said in September it had four months to complete certification, said it could not rule out that Nord Stream 2 operations could start soon, adding that all technical requirements had been met. read more

But Gazprom’s ability to supply more volumes to Europe could be limited this winter as it is still filling its own domestic gas storages and already producing close to a 10-year high, said analysts at Bank of America.

Last month, Norway’s Equninor EQNR.OL, Europe’s second largest supplier, said it would increase natural gas exports to Europe. Norway supplies just under a third of Britain’s gas. read more

WHY RETAIL PRICE RISES?

Many energy suppliers announced hikes to retail tariffs in recent months, passing a higher wholesale cost on to consumers.

Wholesale costs can make up a large chunk of a bill. In Britain, for example, on a dual fuel bill (electricity and gas), the wholesale cost can account for 40% of the total.

So when wholesale market prices rise significantly, suppliers can hike consumer retail tariffs.

What makes up a UK household dual fuel bill?

Suppliers can buy energy in the wholesale market on the day of delivery, a day ahead and up to months or seasons in advance.

They have to try and predict when the price will be cheaper and buy the right amount to cover their customer needs.

If suppliers do not buy enough energy, they might have to buy more at a price which could be higher, depending on market movements. This year, prices have kept on climbing all summer.

CAN ANYONE INTERVENE?

European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has said she would soon present a plan to overhaul the EU gas market.

One of the ideas, proposed by Spain, is for the EU to buy gas jointly to take advantage of the power of its single market of 450 million consumers and create a strategic EU gas reserve but details are scant on how that would work. read more

Some national governments have announced measures to try and ease the winter burden on households, such as subsidies, price caps or redirecting energy company profits to consumers. read more

Britain, which relies heavily on gas for heating, introduced a price cap on the most widely used energy tariffs in 2019 aimed at ending what former Prime Minister Theresa May called “rip-off” pricing.

However, Britain’s energy regulator Ofgem has raised the cap on the most widely used tariffs, called standard variable tariffs, by 12-13% from October. It said on Friday it expects a “significant” rise of the cap again next April. read more

Proposals for UK government intervention have included state loans and the creation of a “bad bank” to support energy suppliers, as well as a windfall tax to help ease the burden on household bills.

“It is, however, unclear how any of such proposals could be implemented and what their impact on the industry would be,” said Moody’s Investor Service.

WHAT CAN CONSUMERS DO?

Due to a deregulated market, Britain has had some of the biggest choice in energy suppliers for consumers.

In a market of now around 40 suppliers, smaller firms have less capital to hedge their wholesale power purchases against soaring prices and nine firms serving over 1.7 million customers, or 6% of the market, have ceased trading since the beginning of September. read more

Consumers are usually encouraged to switch providers or to a cheaper tariff.

However, consumer groups in Britain now say standard variable tariffs, subject to the price cap, are among the cheapest as smaller suppliers fail and there are no longer cheaper deals available.

“But the cap level isn’t the maximum anyone will pay. The price cap sets a limit on the rates you pay for each unit of gas and electricity, so if you use more, you’ll pay more,” said Andrew Capstick, energy analyst at price comarison website moneysupermarket.com

Regulators such as Britain’s Ofgem urge consumers to contact their energy provider if they are struggling to pay their bills to explain when and how much can be paid.

Energy efficiency measures, such as improved insulation, energy efficient lighting and smart meters are also advised, but could require upfront costs. Reducing energy usage is much easier in the summer months."

The world’s most important but least appreciated energy source is natural gas.While the headlines are about what is good or bad about coal, oil, nuclear power, hydroelectricity and renewables, the second largest global primary energy source is natural gas.BP’s 2021 BP Statistical Review of World Energy reports that gas – or methane – supplies 18 per cent more energy than coal, nuclear, hydro and renewables combined.Every day we’re advised that natural gas is a fossil fuel and therefore must go. Therefore its use and development is continuously criticized or obstructed. This includes opposing hydraulic fracturing, blocking pipelines, fighting LNG exports, and shutting down gas-fired electricity generation.What is rarely mentioned is that gas is essential for manufacturing the ammonia/nitrogen-based fertilizer that helps feed over three billion people, and associated liquids are key building blocks of essential plastics and petrochemicals.

The largest single GHG emissions reduction in history was the U.S. replacing coal with shale gas for electricity generation. Climate activists dutifully opposed the replacement fuel’s development.

Canada contains significant natural gas resources and is the world’s sixth largest producer. Excluding uranium, gas provides nearly one-third of Canada’s primary energy.

Natural gas from Western Canada has been wonderful for our country. Using methane as feedstock, Calgary began producing fertilizer in 1941 with a company today known as global giant Nutrien. In 1957 clean burning gas from northeast B.C. saved Vancouver from choking on smoke and fumes all winter from burning wood waste for heat. The TransCanada pipeline put Ontario and Quebec homes and businesses on gas in 1958.

After market deregulation in 1985, a new gas development and export boom began in western Canada that continues today. Starting in 2008, enormous new supplies were unlocked from shale reservoirs using new technology. Since then, enormous quantities of low-cost gas has provided North Americans with cheap energy and a significant competitive advantage economically.

This is incredibly important now. Gas is headline news not because it is damaging to the environment, but because there’s not enough of it.

Shortages in Europe and Asia are driving electricity prices through the roof. Major industries are shutting down as energy prices skyrocket. Electricity spot prices across Europe in late September were two to four times the average fixed price in Alberta. A cold winter will force prices higher. People may freeze.

It’s worse in Asia. Spot LNG prices reached US$34.47 per MMBtu on September 30 as global competition for gas supply intensifies. The five-month average futures prices for the Korea/Japan LNG Marker Futures for the upcoming winter was US$40 on October 6. This is seven times the recent U.S. Henry Hub price, and ten times that of Alberta’s AECO benchmark.

International natural gas shortages and exploding prices have been exacerbated by years of anti-fossil fuel activism and sympathetic political support. The UK and most of Europe has opposed fracking and new natural gas development. International shortages have created a huge and growing LNG market in the U.S., with exports reaching 10.7 billion cubic feet per day earlier this year. That’s nearly two-thirds of total Canadian production of 16.8 bcf/day.

Canadian gas producers have been trying to grow an LNG export business for years but have faced significant obstacles from challenging economics to relentless opposition.

Nevertheless, in 2018 LNG Canada decided to proceed with the largest private sector project in Canadian history, $40 billion. It will be producing in 2025.

But in July, Quebec killed the $14 billion Saguenay LNG export project, ostensibly to protect the environment.

Climate virtue signaling has made it fashionable to shut down or reject natural gas electricity generation. But recent power shortages in California and Texas have regulators reconsidering if gas isn’t an essential source of backup energy when the sun isn’t shining, or the wind isn’t blowing.

Regrettably, these lessons are only learned after the lights go out. Gas is an ideal partner for renewables until electricity storage technology achieves the scale to provide carbon-free power 24/7/365.

Electricity shortages and high gas prices this winter will hopefully cause many to rethink the decarbonization-at-any-cost mantra that has dominated climate politics for the past decade.

Too bad so many will have to suffer to ensure that methane and common sense remain key elements of energy transition planning.
