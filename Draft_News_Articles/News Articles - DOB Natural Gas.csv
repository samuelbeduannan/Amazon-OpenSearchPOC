"['Tom Pavic', 'Sayer Energy Advisors']",9/29/2021,"A total of $5.5 billion in equity and debt was raised in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry in the first six months of 2021, down 19 per cent from the $6.8 billion over the same time period in 2020. Equity financings were up significantly year-over-year while the amount of debt raised declined.

Equity financings in the first six months of 2021 increased 135 per cent to $839.2 million compared to

$356.5 million in 2020, while debt financings decreased 28 per cent to $4.7 billion from $6.5 billion in the first half of 2020.

The $839.2 million in equity raised in the first half of 2021 accounted for 15 per cent of the total capital raised, up from five per cent in 2020 and 12 per cent in 2019. The top three equity issuances, totalling $408.6 million, accounted for 49 per cent of the total equity raised in the first six months of 2021.

Topaz Energy Corp. completed the largest equity financing in the first half of 2021 when, in May, it announced a $201.3 million bought deal financing. The total $201.3 million raised includes the over-allotment which was exercised in June for total proceeds of $26.3 million. The financing was announced concurrently with Topaz’s acquisition of a newly created gross overriding royalty interest (“GORR”) from Tourmaline Oil Corp. in northeastern British Columbia for $245.0 million and GORR interests from Cenovus Energy Inc. in the Marten Hills area of Alberta for $102.0 million. Topaz, concurrent with the bought deal financing, closed a private placement equity offering for approximately $3.0 million.

Enerplus Corporation completed the second highest equity financing in the first six months of 2021 with a bought deal financing for total proceeds of $132.3 million. The total $132.3 million raised includes the over-allotment which was exercised in February for total proceeds of $17.3 million. The financing was announced concurrently with Enerplus’ acquisition of Bruin E&P HoldCo, LLC for

US$465.0 million. Bruin’s oil and natural gas interests were located in the state of North Dakota.

Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. completed the third largest equity financing in the first half of 2021 also through a bought deal financing for total proceeds of $75.0 million. The total $75.0 million raised includes the over-allotment which was exercised in April for total proceeds of $6.8 million. The bought deal financing was announced concurrently with Tamarack Valley’s acquisition of assets from Surge Energy Inc. for $106.0 million and the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Woodcote Petroleum Inc. for total consideration of approximately $43.0 million.

Debt financings in the first six months of 2021 totalled $4.7 billion, accounting for 85 per cent of the total capital raised in the first half of 2021. Of the $4.7 billion of debt that was raised in the first six months of 2021, the majority (99 per cent) of the debt issues have been comprised of straight debt. Convertible debt accounted for only $47.7 million or one per cent of the total debt financings in the first half of the year.

Suncor Energy Inc. completed the largest debt financing in the first six months of 2021, when it announced in March an unsecured note offering of $947.8 million (US$750.0 million) with a 30-year term and a coupon rate of 3.75 per cent. Suncor concurrent with the $947.8 million financing also announced a $500.0 million unsecured note offering with a 30-year term and a coupon rate of 3.95 per cent. Suncor used the proceeds of its debt offerings towards the repayment of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

MEG Energy Corp. completed the second highest debt financing in the first half of 2021 in February with a senior unsecured note offering of $769.1 million (US$600.0 million) with an eight-year term and a coupon rate of 5.875 per cent. MEG used the net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem its US$600.0 million unsecured notes due March 2024 with a coupon rate of 7.00 per cent.

ARC Resources Ltd. completed the third largest debt financing in the first six months of 2021 in March with the issuance of $550.0 million in unsecured notes with a 10-year term and a coupon rate of 3.465 per cent. ARC, concurrent with the $550.0 million financing, also announced a $450.0 million unsecured note offering with a coupon rate of 2.354 per cent and a five-year term. ARC used the net proceeds of the offering towards the redemption and/or purchase of the outstanding senior notes of Seven Generations Energy Ltd., which ARC completed a business combination with in April 2021.

In the third quarter of 2021 to date, a total of approximately $3.3 billion in capital has been raised, consisting of $2.8 billion in debt and approximately $500.0 million in equity. With strengthening commodity prices coupled with low interest rates, we forecast the amount of capital which will be raised in 2021 will be in line with the total $10.9 billion raised in 2020."
['Dob Staff'],9/24/2021,"Chief executive officers of a basket of Canadian gas producers received similar total compensation in 2020 compared to 2019, according to new analysis by CanOils of Canadian CEO compensation.

The CEOs of gas producers fared better than those of oil-weighted companies or oilsands producers.

In total, 38 TSX-listed companies are included in the analysis (also see Notes). The companies, all with output of over 1,000 boe/d for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, have over 75 per cent of their production in Canada. Any no-longer-active company was excluded (e.g. Husky Energy Inc., Seven Generations Energy Ltd.).

The 38 producers were split into three peer groups:

Gas producers (18): <50 per cent oil;

Oil producers (15): >50 per cent oil, excluding the oilsands majors; and,

Oilsands majors (5): Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, MEG Energy Corp. and Suncor Energy Inc.

“Total compensation for the CEOs of gas producers was flat in 2020 after it had already taken a very steep dive between 2018 and 2019,” said Mark Young, senior oil and gas analyst with CanOils.

Total compensation includes: executive salary, option based awards, share based awards and incentive plans (bonuses).

The data excludes anything listed as “other compensation” and any change in pension value reported. (“Other compensation” is mainly made up of large severance packages that skew the data set, in addition to smaller dollar amounts classified as “undisclosed.”)

The compensation breakdown for CEOs of gas producer was very nearly unchanged from 2019 to 2020.

“These CEOs have received more salary and bonus in both 2019 and 2020 than in previous years as a percentage of all compensation paid,” noted Young.

Moreover, salary and bonus make up 61 per cent of pay, much higher than in the other two groups.

In addition, 13 CEOs from gas-weighted producers saw their total compensation cut in 2020 but only seven saw a reduction in executive salary.

Oil producers

Total compensation has steadily declined for oil company CEOs since 2017, but has not reached the lows of 2016 despite the pandemic.

Young said 2020 pay saw more bonuses as a percentage of total pay, while share-based awards were reduced.

“Still, share-based awards dominate pay for oil company CEOs, and even with a drop below 50 per cent of total pay for the first time, 47 per cent is easily the largest figure of any group,” he added.

Two-thirds of the CEOs from oil-weighted producers saw their total compensation reduced year over year in 2020, while 11 saw a reduction in executive salary.

Oilsands producers

Total compensation for CEOs from oilsands producers took a steep, 32-per-cent decline in 2020 versus 2019 and is now lower than it was in any of the last six years.

Total compensation was leaning more towards options and share-based awards combined in 2020 compared to any other year. “The 12 per cent of total compensation made up of salary for oilsands producers is much lower than the oil or gas producers,” Young said.

All five CEOs saw their executive salary drop.

All companies

After a slight bump in salary overall in 2019, the 38 CEOs saw a drop in total compensation in 2020.

Looking across all companies, Young noted the compensation packages for CEOs are pretty much unchanged from year to year.

He said that 27 CEOs (71 per cent) saw their total compensation cut in 2020, with 23 of those seeing a reduction in executive salary.

Along with financial, operating and well-level performance data for all of Canada’s oil and gas producers, CanOils holds compensation data for CEOs, CFOs, COOs and other executives and directors for every TSX and TSX-V producer back to 2009. Visit CanOils for more information.

['Darrell Stonehouse'],10/4/2021,"Skyrocketing inactive well counts are driving major changes to Alberta’s liability management regulations, two experts told an exclusive Daily Oil Bulletin subscriber webinar held in September.

Key changes to the liability management framework, released in July 2020, include liability reduction spending targets and timelines, corporate financial health assessments, and legacy and post-closure site management requirements, said Brad Herald, vice-president for Western Canada Operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). Herald described the new liability framework as the “most significant package of changes in a generation.”

The framework is currently being converted into regulations at the AER, with the final draft of a new Directive expected this fall.

Low commodity prices, COVID-19, and a lack of focus on closure in Western Canada has led to a large inactive well inventory, said Herald. In Alberta, there are now 96,000 inactive wells. The tough economic times have also resulted in a major increase in orphan wells, climbing from 578 in 2014 to 7,782 in 2020 as companies went bankrupt throughout the downturn. The Orphan Well Association (OWA) budget has climbed to $72 million from $12 million in response. While the OWA is funded by industry, there is concern the public could be left holding the bag if numbers were allowed to increase.

“The bottom line for government is to protect the public from liability of orphan sites,” Herald said.

Adding to the urgency in dealing with inactive wells was the four-year saga surrounding Redwater Energy Corp. In 2015, Redwater became insolvent and its receiver advised the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) that it would only take control of around 20 of the 127 sites that still held value. AER issued a closure order, and the trustee/receiver disclaimed the uneconomic assets. The case worked its way up to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), and in early 2019 the court found receivers or trustees cannot walk away from the environmental obligations. Had the case gone the other way, it would have had significant impacts on the OWA, said Herald.

In the time leading up to the SCC decision, receivers and trustees renounced their interest in more than 10,000 AER-licensed sites. Renounced sites had deemed liabilities of almost $335 million, increasing OWA’s inventory by more than 300 per cent.

“Redwater was the point where the potential risks crystalized,” said Herald.

Both the previous Alberta NDP government and current UCP government, along with CAPP, have put a high priority on reducing the inactive well count. CAPP’s goal throughout has been to influence the legislation and new regulations to ensure they took a systematic approach to both reducing inactive assets while managing costs, said Herald.

The AER is currently building the new liability management framework into a Directive containing the requirements and processes that licensees must follow in managing their asset retirement obligations (AROs).

“This is the first time the regulator has been given legislation to reduce AROs,” said Mark Taylor, a former AER executive now leading Taylor Energy Advisors. “Up until the last two governments there was not much enthusiasm in government to provide a legislative background for new regulations.”

The new Directive will set out mandatory annual spending targets for well closure activity, said Taylor. But it will not proscribe to licensees how the money must be spent. It will allow for technology development, area-based closure efforts, and other opportunities to optimize and manage ARO costs. “Proscriptive regulations limit that. The legislation is focused on outcomes.”

The mandatory spending targets provide flexibility to the AER to manage inactive well counts, Taylor adds. “It’s easy to change spending targets. If counts come down like a rock it can tighten up on spending targets. Regulators can turn the dial up to reduce well counts if needed. It’s a simple tool and very transparent. The spending targets are released years out so companies can plan.”

Another key element of the new regulations is a much more intensive review of the financial health of licensees throughout the lifecycle of the assets they hold, designed to replace the Licensee Liability Rating (LLR) program.

“The LLR is not a tool designed to assess the health of a company,” said Taylor, pointing out there have been companies reporting good LLR scores that went into insolvency a month or two later.

The new system will take a holistic view of the financial health of operators that seeks to understand the short-, medium-, and long-term risks facing licensees. For public companies, it will use existing financial data to identify risks. For private companies it will use data that lenders would use in assessing risks.

“It’s about full lifecycle management,” Taylor said. “Historically, no one worried about AROs until end of life. Now licensees have to focus on AROs before they have one foot into insolvency. They need to be on top of AROs early on.”

Taylor said the new Directive is unlikely to be the last word on dealing with the backlog of inactive assets.

“There is going to be additional updates and likely adjustments,” he said.

Quality Indigenous partnerships are instrumental to the success of projects and strategies throughout Canada. As one of the fastest growing labour forces in the country, Indigenous peoples are becoming industry drivers in several business capacities including management, production, commercial enterprise and more.

Indigenous journalist and communications professional Stephanie Joe sat down with Bennett Jones partners Sharon Singh (commercial and regulatory law), Ashley White (corporate law) and Luke Morrison (corporate law) as well as Fluor Canada Ltd.'s Mark Brown (Vice President & General Manager) and Lori Janson (Director, Project Communications & External Affairs) to understand how their client’s Indigenous partnership strategies are working to create an equitable relationship for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners. What followed was a thorough discussion of client relations and Indigenous partnerships.

Bennett Jones is one of Canada’s premier business law firms and home to 500 lawyers and business advisors. Bennett Jones has been intimately involved in virtually every major energy development project in Canada in the past 20 years, representing project proponents, investors and other stakeholders. We provide complete ESG-related advice to clients that helps them seize ESG opportunities, minimize compliance gaps, and mitigate risks.

Fluor has provided engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, and project management services to Canada’s energy industry for 72 years. Its 43,000 employees globally (and 3,000+ across Canada) deliver comprehensive services — from conceptual design through to commissioning and maintenance — for all types and sizes of facilities.

Fluor is committed to positively contributing to Canada’s energy tomorrow by focusing on safe and sustainable solutions today. This commitment includes focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion to ensure opportunities represent the diversity of Canada’s population and support reconciliation, partnerships, and benefit-sharing with Indigenous peoples.

PART ONE: Foundational components of progressive Indigenous partnerships

Q: When it comes to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), is it a board level discussion?

Bennett Jones (BJ): The discussion around ESG, its importance as a driver of an organization's performance, its implementation, measurement and reporting, typically permeates through the entire organization. It is neither limited to nor driven by the board. Our clients, their investors, employees, regulators, and other stakeholders are either very aware, or are raising their awareness, of the importance of ESG to their long-term sustainability and performance. The importance of meaningful engagement and partnerships with Indigenous peoples is an integral component of a company's ESG performance. Meaningful inclusion of Indigenous peoples and including their perspectives is not limited to the “Social” pillar. Rather, Indigenous peoples are important drivers of all three ESG pillars.

Factoring ESG considerations into corporate decision-making is not new, including from a legal perspective where legislation and jurisprudence has existed for decades. However, companies are increasingly being scrutinized on their ESG performance by shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. Indigenous peoples have been factoring and scrutinizing investment opportunities with an ESG lens before the term was created. We work with our clients to understand the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples, and how this should factor into their corporate decision-making, and help clients identify, develop, and implement ESG-related solutions and strategies in connection with policy changes at the governmental level.

Fluor (F): Our leadership makes it a priority. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) are a big part of the “S” in ESG. We often use EDI as a dialogue in communities including with our client base, peers, competitors, subcontractors and vendors. When we ask people to involve themselves as a provider of a product or service, that “S” is a big part of what we ask about now. There's a value chain, not just from our leadership through our governance and our execution, but also those that we do business with.

Q: Sovereignty and self-governance are significant in Indigenous communities. Are there any steps taken towards training members of the community?

F: We’re about building capacity, leaving a legacy and sharing success with those in the community. To that end, we are continually seeking ways to leave long-lasting positive impacts in the communities we serve.

BJ: In addition to the growing sophistication of mutual benefit agreements, there has been an increase in opportunities for meaningful equity ownership. The goals of these partnerships is to create community resilience and prosperity. This includes providing capacity building and meaningful avenues to the Indigenous community partner to participate in the governance and affairs of the project. Meaningful partnerships help communities become self-reliant and generate additional economic opportunities which are driven by Indigenous values and worldview.

Q: How are companies investing in making Indigenous partnerships a priority versus an afterthought?

BJ: Companies that are making this a priority are embedding it as a core value, similar to safety. Companies that do not view Indigenous partnerships as creating potential opportunities and are not proactive in finding pathways to partnerships will leave value on the table.

Investment in these partnerships includes companies creating a culture of inclusion, educating employees, contractors and other constituents to understand the inherent rights, history of, and current realities of Indigenous peoples. These companies understand that they, and each Canadian, have a role in reconciliation.

F: When you invest in health, safety and environment, it’s an equalizer. I see Indigenous partnerships in the same light. It’s about people helping people that would generally be competing to share each other's learnings.

We have a progressive Indigenous relations strategy at Fluor — it’s not like we're going to get to an equilibrium point, and then we're done with our Indigenous relations strategy. It has to progress to a point where it becomes second nature, like thinking about safety.

Q: How does materiality come in to play with all partnership developments?

F: One example that allows us to demonstrate materiality is when we invest in our project orientations; every person that comes to a worksite is required to go through orientation and cultural awareness. It’s an hour and a half of listening to an Elder and an external facilitator as they take you through the land you're sitting on and why it's important. And it’s for all individuals, regardless of their role on the project.

When you ask people, ‘how was orientation?’ They say two things, ‘very comprehensive training for safety, and what an impact’ — and they hold up their reference materials that explains things like the Indian Act, cultural rights and some historical presence. It leaves such an impact from a materiality viewpoint.

BJ: Materiality is a strategic business tool — it is used to assess both risk and opportunity. We use it to identify trends, policy changes, legislative developments, and potential areas of interest that are relevant to how a company operates.

On the other hand, we also use materiality as a means of describing the baseline requirement for ongoing transparent, purposeful, and proactive or timely disclosure of information to Indigenous partners and communities. Timely sharing of relevant information is critical to decision-making.

PART TWO: How do we measure, calibrate and govern as we go along?

Q: How do you measure success?

Fluor (F): What we thought success was a couple of years ago continues to evolve and it turns out it was not where we needed to be. We need to continue to learn and demonstrate that we haven’t stopped learning.

At the same time, it’s about building relationships in the community. When you get to a point where you can pick up the phone or have a coffee with a Chief and vice versa, it’s about keeping that two-way communication open, and everyone has an equal seat at the table. To me, those are the things that measure success.

Bennett Jones (BJ): Measuring success requires an assessment of whether the outcomes of the partnership are meeting each party’s objectives. These objectives could be whether the partnership is commercially viable and provides predictable revenue streams to support community investment and develop capacity, including in project governance.

There are some factors that can be measured: percentage of Indigenous ownership, numbers of Indigenous employees, Indigenous representation on the board of directors, contracts with Indigenous businesses, support for Indigenous community organizations, among other things. However, it is also important to note that measuring success is not just a quantitative assessment, or a Western worldview of prosperity.

The legacy of the partnership needs to be considered beyond the life of the projects in order for relationships and trust to be sustained.

Broadly speaking, a key indicator that should be measured is whether the partnership is contributing to reconciliation between Indigenous communities and non-Indigenous Canada. This must be a priority if our country is to make a high standard of living available to all and preserve its reputation as a responsible global citizen and its track record as a superior place to invest.

Q: How do you keep two-way communication open to build trust?

BJ: In our experience, you must have transparency and access to relevant and timely information. Relevant information is understated but critical to facilitate timely discussions and informed decision-making. This assists in meeting important requirements such as meeting project schedules. Understanding what information is needed by each party, in what format, and when, is often overlooked but also critical to help build the foundation of trust. If it’s a new relationship, parties should engage in understanding each other’s governance processes and expectations. This assists in developing an effective and constructive communication and engagement process with well-defined KPIs.

There are processes and systems that we use to help clients create multiple lines of communication to resolve technical, governance or relationship issues.

F: When we work on permitting, we have requirements to engage with First Nations early on. It could be setting up a meeting, going through a slide deck and talking about where we’re at in the permitting process. We have the First Nations review our documents and give them an opportunity to provide feedback before it goes to the regulatory authorities. Overall, it’s a combination of regular communications and sincere engagement with First Nations groups.

Q: What are the opportunities that come from being good at partnerships and building trust in Indigenous communities?

F: Relationships don’t begin with automatic trust; it needs to be earned. When it comes to Indigenous partnerships, things may start off slowly because of more than 100 years of history behind these relationships. You have to approach those relationships from a perspective of gaining and maintaining trust.

Avoid tokenism. When a company holds up the number of how many Indigenous people have been hired as a badge, that’s a sure-fire way to erode trust. That isn’t evidence of having built a relationship.

BJ: It is more about being good partners than being good at partnerships. Even if a partnership fails, the venture may meet the objectives of all parties, which fundamentally look to increase prosperity, in a manner that is defined by each party. There are also opportunities to leverage connections, different perspectives and worldviews, capacity and capital that’s built through these partnerships. We identify these opportunities and then implement them in a myriad of situations, from mutual benefit agreements to equity ownership ventures. In an era where the importance of ESG is being more widely understood, the risk of not being a good partner will only impact the long-term sustainability of the company.

The opportunities that arise from industry-Indigenous partnerships include being able to respond quickly to funding opportunities, requests for proposals or investment opportunities. We expect that the exponential growth and momentum of new partnerships will intensify as both Indigenous and non-Indigenous clients alike increasingly look to leverage such relationships.

Q: Who needs to be knowledgeable about what makes a good partnership?

F: Anyone and everyone throughout an organization, but also the community we engage with — family members, vendors, contractors, consultants and clients. One of the things we learned through our Progressive Indigenous Relations plan through the Canada Council for Aboriginal Business was that we actually had to sit down and make commitments, come up with vision statements, and we had to understand that this is not just something we publish and put on our website. Anything worthwhile takes a lot of effort, time and commitment.

BJ: It’s everybody. This is one area where it’s both a top-down and bottom-up approach. You need to also have the diversity of experience, knowledge and views around the table to push each other forward.

As advisers, we can add value to such partnerships by helping to outline for the parties what range of options are available to address a particular issue or set of concerns. As these partnerships become more prevalent, we are seeing market trends emerge for key deal points and on that basis are able to present solutions and roadmaps in order to expedite negotiations. We look at it from taking the big picture objectives to finding pathways to implement them, so the words are not hollow.

In June, Publicis Sapient launched this unique awards program — The Global EnergyTech Awards. The focus is on the transformation and development of technology within the energy sector with entries open to startups, small businesses, developers and engineers across the world. The timing is spot on — the industry is going through significant change and the transition to a carbon zero future is underway, so there’s a lot of focus and demand in this area. Energy companies will increasingly have to partner with innovators in order to scale-up the skills and technology required to reach both their own and global net zero goals.

As a recognized leader of new technologies, Publicis Sapient want to bring the best ideas and talent together, leading the charge in this shift to a cleaner, greener world.

Joe Tabita, Energy Leader for EMEA and APAC at Publicis Sapient says, “These are exciting times in EnergyTech. The energy transition is driving new customer behaviors and expectations. Competition has jumped across business and geographical boundaries. There’s a huge opportunity for digital to be a core ingredient as the industry transforms how it produces, stores, trades and delivers energy.”

The Global EnergyTech Awards aim to embrace this opportunity and encourage the sharing and implementation of new ideas and technologies that will indeed transform the industry in years to come. Entries are open until the end of September, when judges from both Publicis Sapient and leading energy companies will select a short list of potential winners to present their ideas live to the panel. Winners will be announced and awards presented during a dual London/Houston ceremony in November.

Years in the making

The company at the helm is a well-respected powerhouse. For 30 years Publicis Sapient has been leading the way in digital business transformation within many industries, including energy. The consultancy is growing fast despite the economic downturn of 2020, with 53 offices across the globe from Calgary to London to Dubai. They’ve helped, and continue to help, some of the biggest names in the energy sector to make step changes towards a digital-first model as they move resources across the supply chain — all the way from generation, production and distribution to trading, supply and retail.

Publicis Sapient were originally known for energy and commodities trading. This is where the consultancy started out, disrupting a traditional industry with digital transformation and bringing it into the digital age by offering more choice when it comes to E/CTRM. This expertise is recognized in the Awards with a category dedicated to ‘Best Solution in Energy Trading’, which will hopefully shine light on new ways of working.

Now — and increasingly as we emerge from this crisis — identifying the most effective ways to reduce costs, improve operations and move faster to capture new opportunities will decide the future of energy trading organizations. Energy and commodities trading groups will therefore want to address customers and opportunities that have gained in strategic value as a result of these crises, and to leave markets that have been undermined by it. If they are to succeed, they have no choice but to transform themselves. Perhaps using the technology from winners of the Global EnergyTech Awards. The relatively slow progress of digital business transformation in this sector means that a major opportunity remains in play: removing low-value processes, which frees up the organization’s money and talent to focus on areas with the greatest potential for value creation. This allows more of the organization’s intellectual firepower to be used for activities where it can achieve a competitive edge. Too much of the upside of digitalization remains untapped. There is too little automation, too many data silos, too many in-house data centers and too many off-the-shelf IT packages with overlapping functionalities, and not enough consistency of process and technology across participants in the market.

Shaping the future of utilities

Another focus for Publicis Sapient’s energy team is digital utilities where the disruption of the energy market is in full swing. Today’s energy customer demands choice, affordability and trust. They expect providers to understand what they need. As some of the more established providers lag behind, more agile, digitally-driven players are emerging to turn up the heat and hopefully some will be entering the Global EnergyTech Awards to showcase their innovations.

The work of Publicis Sapient ensures that new or existing services are modernized in ways that enrich the life of the business or the end consumer, whether that’s more efficient business processes or smarter interfaces to warm the home.

Publicis Sapient are big enough to lead, but small enough to empathize, which is proved by the creation of the Global EnergyTech Awards — an exciting initiative that will bridge the gap between major energy organizations and the startups that will shape the industry of tomorrow. When the results are announced in November, there will be a curated list of the very best new minds in energy and we can’t wait to see it.

[],9/8/2021,"With eight categories and a global reach, these brand-new awards promise to open doors for anyone ready to step forward. The inaugural Publicis Sapient Global EnergyTech Awards are open for entries until the end of September and aim to celebrate the new innovations and developments within the energy industry.

We examine just what the judges are looking for and how startups can use this opportunity to catch the eye of major energy organizations and win invaluable support from mentors within Publicis Sapient.

The categories cover a broad range of the digital spectrum, from EV solutions to smart networks to mobile experiences. With prizes including promotion in Wired Magazine and at VivaTech 2022 as well as the mentoring, the introductions and the kudos itself, there’s enough of an incentive for entrants. But which category to enter? Here’s the run down.

Best Customer Omni-channel Experience

Whether it’s business to consumer, business to business or business to employee, this category is after impressive customer experiences that stand out above the rest. As with many industries, in the energy market a good brand experience can create the kind of loyalty that makes the difference between success and failure. Judges will look for how entrants are using new technologies, the uniqueness of the idea and how it delivers against business objectives. Bonus points if you touch on sustainability.

Best CleanTech

If you have a technology or business idea that makes a positive environmental impact, this is the category for you. Sure to be popular in this time of energy transition, your entry will need to be original to rise to the top. Open to B2B or B2C, it must have scalability and big potential to add value for society or users. Maybe you’ve developed a way to increase the use of clean energy, up energy efficiency or extend the life of energy assets, or maybe something that CleanTech hasn’t even touched on before. It’s an open door into a big CleanTech world.

Best EV Customer Solution

How can companies get more people using electric vehicles? How can the current infrastructure be improved? If you have the answer, look at this category of the Global EnergyTech Awards. Judges will be looking for innovations around charging, search, funding or facilities and only ideas that are extendable with strong commercial prospects. You’ll need to explain just how much it benefits drivers, how data is leveraged and the future prospects if you’re going to be crowned the winner.

Best Mobile Customer Experience

Have you created a completely new app that will delight and engage the users? Then this is the category for you. Prove the originality and quality of your idea and explain how it will have an impact on the energy industry on your application and maybe the prize will be yours. Focus will be on interface design, accessibility, how it brings to life new data, content or functionality and how it ties in to and exemplifies the brand.

Best Solution in Energy Trading

Next generation systems, platforms and applications are keeping the world’s energy moving. For the Best Solution in Energy Trading, Publicis Sapient are seeking tech aimed at supply, trading, operations or risk management – a product that caters for an emerging need or complements/betters existing solutions. The winner must demonstrate automation, market efficiency, productivity, transparency, as well as creating a positive user experience and using digital in an innovative way.

Best Use of Data & Insights

This award is open to those using structured, unstructured and streaming data in an innovative way within the EnergyTech industry. Customer data, third-party data or...any data. For those startups in this area, enter via the online forms detailing how the data was generated, whether it was combined with data/its correlation to other data and how well your tool can extrapolate data and close any gaps. Plus, any results you’ve uncovered and what implications they have.

Best Smart Network Solution

This is your opportunity to showcase ay new products and technologies that will help energy networks (transmission and distribution) remain reliable, safe and efficient against the backdrop of changing customer preferences, the energy transition and society’s shift towards a low carbon economy. This award will recognize new, scalable solutions that have the potential to create sustainable benefits for energy customers, networks and the broader system.

Standout Performer

Publicis Sapient has also announced that from all entries, judges will select a ‘Standout Performer’ - one that deserves special recognition and will receive the same prizes as the other category winners.

['Josh Skapin'],9/9/2021,"A spacer technology said to provide significant time savings for drilling operations has taken a major step forward.

This past June, Sanjel Energy Services was granted patents for its VISWEEP DM (dry mix) IS (invert systems). The spacer system that creates efficiencies through its mix-on-the-fly approach was developed at Sanjel Energy’s technical centre.

“The VISWEEP DM IS spacer system is the next evolution in our spacer family and another excellent example of our commitment to providing our clients with a broad range of innovative solutions,” said Murray Bickley, president and CEO of Sanjel Energy.

Spacer is a fluid that functions as a buffer between well fluids and cement slurry. This helps displace drilling fluid and gets the walls of the wellbore conditioned for cement bonding.

The photos above show the before and after of one of the tests that Sanjel does to test how effectively a spacer system can remove mud. The apparatus is immersed in oil based mud to coat it, then it is immersed in the spacer and turned on for a fixed period of time after which the apparatus is removed from the spacer to determine how effective the spacer was at removing the oil based mud.

The VISWEEP DM IS includes a rapid hydrating polymer mixed, weighting material, and pH modifiers to optimize the mixing process, says the company.

Aimed to improve cement bonding, the system uses powdered chemicals to convert oil-wet casing and formations to water-wet.

This innovation is a particularly valuable asset for longer, complex wells in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, where horizontal sections are common.

While traditional methods have worked for standard vertical wells, when there are horizontal sections, drilling operations face an additional hurdle.

Previously, vertical wells typically reached 3,500 to 4,000 metres. Today, however, wells are commonly 2,500 metres with horizontal sections reaching up to 6,000 metres. This adds to the operation’s hole cleaning and mud displacement workload.

“Batching large spacer volumes may require additional tanks or units, which increases both complexity and the chance of contamination,” says Jeff Spence, Sanjel’s vice-president, operations and innovation, calling it a “labour-intensive process.”

“In the past, if you would hand-mix it, you’d give the operator your recipe, they’d go out to the location, have a series of buckets of and a series of bags of different chemicals and they’d put that all together,” he adds.

At an eight cubic metre volume, VISWEEP DM IS shortens this mixing process from nearly two hours to 15 minutes, says Sanjel.

This system was first used in November 2018 and since then has been used in more than 700 jobs.

“The technology is really optimized around rapidly achieving properties,” Spence says. “What we wanted to be able to do was mix this on the fly so there are a bunch of efficiency gains for us and for our clients and be able to take a lot of the risk off the table.”

There are some indirect benefits to the environment, as well.

“The energy efficiency aspect of it comes from the amount of time that you’re saving out there,” says Spence. “You don’t have the rig and all the other support equipment sitting around for that 110 minutes of additional mixing time waiting for you to get ready with your spacer to go downhole.”

The emissions savings connected to shopping local supports the case for VISWEEP DM IS, as well.

“A lot of the conventional systems tend to use barite, and barite tends to be sourced out of Asia,” says Spence. “We use, for the most part, a locally-sourced weighting agent that comes out of Alberta.”

Sanjel will clamp down on carbon emissions even further with a new eco-blend line-up of cement.

The company says its new cement has 25 per cent less CO2 output than class G cement, which is standard in the oilfield, and 30 per cent less than the average cement used in Canada."
['Darrell Stonehouse'],8/20/2021,"Editor’s note: Last year, when assembling the 2020 Top Operators Report, the COVID-19 pandemic had shuttered the global economy. Oil demand had been reduced by over 20 million bbls/d and prices were at lows not seen in decades.

The mood of the Canadian industry was grim. After five years of being rocked by wild price volatility the pandemic hit like a knockout punch.

The 2021 Top Operators Report looks back at how Canada’s oil and gas leaders pivoted to meet the challenges of 2020, and how they are positioning their organizations for future success.

Once again, we have tapped into the experience of professional services firm KPMG in Canada to provide insight into what strategies operators could pursue to thrive in the current environment.

The report also features a broad swath of the insights and opinions from industry leaders gleaned from Daily Oil Bulletin coverage, along with commentary from data providers Evaluate Energy and CanOils.

The COVID-19 pandemic put many oil and gas operators and oilfield service companies in survival mode.

But that doesn’t mean the push to find operational efficiencies through digital transformation slowed, said Narmin Vasanji, partner, Advisory Services, Management Consulting at KPMG in Canada.

“Working from home proved people could work in different locations. We saw more use of collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams. It forced people to think differently,” she said. “People were thinking of software as a service in the middle of the pandemic. A lot of companies were also looking at data warehouses and data lakes to improve analytics and insights for nimble decision-making.”

“Companies with the resources to weather the storm are now thinking about how to utilize technology and automate. They see it as a competitive advantage,” she added.

The advent of cloud computing is a key driver accelerating the digital transformation, said Vasanji. Larger companies are now accessing their enterprise resource planning (ERP) software over the cloud, providing greater flexibility and easier integration of new data sets. Consolidation in the industry is adding urgency to the shift.

“We’re seeing a lot of consolidation and we will see more consolidation. These all come with synergy targets, often 20-30 per cent in savings,” she said. “Companies need to merge systems and create one source of data truth. For the back office, they need to merge functions post integration, and that creates some challenges. On the operations side there is less impact to staffing but companies always need to get efficiencies out of the transaction.”

“There’s ample opportunity to become more efficient,” she added, highlighting automation in the back office as one often over-looked area. “During the cycle when commodity prices ramp up, companies don’t focus on back office costs. Then there’s a downturn and they layoff employees, leaving those left at the company to perform the jobs of many. The inefficiencies remain.”

Automating repetitive processes is one opportunity, said Vasanji. “Financial processes are a good area to find efficiencies such as invoice automation or automating time sheets from workers in remote locations. This creates capacity for finance teams to focus on forecasting and analysis to help operations make better decisions.”

Even greater opportunities exist through the use of data analytics, said Vasanji. By applying predictive analytics or visualization tools to data, companies can begin to look forward and improve decision-making. For example, basic spend analysis throughout the supply chain to better understand where money is going, to process mining tools that enable visualization of processes to address issues and take action.

Technical data used by geologists, engineers and other disciplines to inform decision-making is also evolving, said Terry Jbeili, geoLOGIC systems ltd. president and chief operating officer. geoLOGIC recently partnered with the Daily Oil Bulletin to survey industry professionals on data usage in current work flows and to identify areas of improvement. The survey results were released in a white paper.

“What we learned is there is a need for technical disciplines within organizations to have easier access to multiple data sets and advanced visualization tools to drive efficiencies,” said Jbeili. “Operational efficiency ranked as the number one reason for using data by the respondents. Other major use cases included project planning and business development (M&A).”

With funds for capital investment in limited supply, Jbeili said having accurate, comparable data and interactive visualization tools to help target spending towards the highest return assets is essential.

“There is an extremely complex interrelationship between reservoir geology, rock characteristics and how different technologies applied during the process of field development interact with the reservoir and affect performance,” said Jbeili. “How well asset teams understand the reservoir and make relevant engineering and technology choices has a major impact on asset value. This requires the ability to validate and integrate numerous data sets and to be able to understand how shifting different variables impacts overall productivity.”

The vast majority of survey respondents reported challenges in integrating different data sets into their workflows. Data silos continue to be a challenge that needs to be addressed, he added.

There is also increasing demand by other technical disciplines to access existing and new data sets, said Jbeili. One example of this is the need for data for environmental disclosures related to ESG reporting. Accessing the needed data sets and visualization tools through cloud computing could help “democratize” data and improve decision-making throughout organizations.

“Cloud computing provides flexibility for lighter data users within large companies who may only use a handful of data sets in their regular workflows,” said Jbeili, adding that in smaller companies it could provide access to data for all disciplines at a lower cost due to not needing to maintain legacy systems.

Forty per cent of survey respondents said their data is cloud-based. Among this number, some companies have totally moved to the cloud, while others are running hybrid systems with some data cloud-based and some hosted internally.

Companies that have migrated data and intelligence tools to the cloud say it provides improved security and lowers costs. Savings are being driven by the reliability of cloud computing, with less downtime experienced by users due to the automation of many processes and with data updates and software updates completed without outages.

Other key benefits to cloud computing cited by survey respondents include scalability, accessibility, flexibility, data and intelligence sharing, and collaboration opportunities — benefits which will only expand as more data sources drive companies’ broadening spectrum of energy intelligence applications, analytics and workflows as well as their need to integrate and report on these data and insights.

It’s not just large companies that can benefit from the digital transformation, Vasanji added. Around one-third of small- and mid-size companies are looking to automate to get rid of paper or are moving to the cloud.

“Everything is scalable,” she said. “There is ERP software for differing sizes of clients, and some are more affordable for smaller companies.”

['Bill Whitelaw'],10/5/2021,"Note: geoLOGIC systems ltd. and JWN Energy are proud sponsors of WPC Canada’s “Team Canada” presence at the World Petroleum Congress in Houston this December. This is the first of several articles highlighting various aspects of WPC Canada’s involvement as it prepares to host the 24th Congress in 2023 in Calgary.

The notion of Canada as a global energy leader is a like a well-cut diamond: it has many facets.

Depending on context, each facet reflects a different dimension of how Canada demonstrates its global chops. There’s production, of course. There’s regulation and environmental performance. There’s innovation and cleantech. There’s safety.

And there’s the ethos aspect that binds it all together.

All these notions have a sound basis for making global claims.

But being a world player presupposes knowing something about the world — particularly one in a state of profound and rapidly evolving energy transition.

Fortunately, Canada has a global ace up its sleeve: the Canadian Association of the World Petroleum Council or WPC Canada. That’s the national committee which represents the country at the World Petroleum Council — a global body accredited by the United Nations. WPC Canada brings together dozens of industry professionals who help keep Canada connected to the world and aligned with the important dialogues that shape the global energy landscape.

Its team is busy these days on two fronts: organizing “Team Canada’s” presence at the 23rd World Petroleum Congress in Houston this December and simultaneously thinking ahead to 2023, when Calgary hosts the 24th Congress.

The tri-annual congresses are where the world gathers; and the meetings represent an ideal opportunity to plug into the critical conversations that are defining the global sector's evolution, noted Richard Masson, WPC Canada’s chair.

“There’s no better way to learn and contribute to global conversations than attending a congress,” explained Masson. “It’s a great place to engage, make connections and understand where the world is headed.”

The 23rd Congress in Houston, Dec. 5-9, will include a Canadian pavilion which will be the centrepiece for a variety of ways Canada will be represented, he added.

Organizers are currently seeking sponsors and exhibitors to join the ranks of companies and organizations like Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Hatch Engineering, the City of Calgary and Invest Alberta Corporation. As momentum picks up, other sponsors are signing on, he added.

“Being a sponsor provides a broad range of branding and connection-making tools,” noted Masson. “We’ve come up with some quite creative ways of helping our sponsors get great value from our various sponsorship packages.”

Houston’s theme will focus on energy innovation.

While Houston organizers are grappling with COVID-related impacts — international travel restrictions are particularly challenging — the plan is still to move ahead, even with reduced numbers.

“We hope the Canadian presence will have a positive impact on the overall Congress, especially as we promote the ways in which we excel at innovation from research and development to operational execution,” explained Denis Painchaud, president of the 2023 organizing committee.

Other Canadian activities will include a networking event, a ministerial session and the closing ceremony, at which Houston organizers will pass the torch to Canada for 2023. In Calgary, the theme will focus on successfully negotiating the complexities of a net-zero world.

But between Houston and Calgary, there will be plenty of work shaping the agenda and aligning with other global stakeholders, he added.

“As the world moves more fully into an energy transition mode, we need to ensure the Calgary congress framework and agenda reflect the diversity of views and perspectives on the complexities of transition and change,” noted Painchaud. “If we’re going to continue to be considered an important global player, Congresses are a great place to stand up and be counted.”

[],10/5/2021,"Introduction

The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) has been an oil and gas exploration and development area since the early 20th century and has generated and continues to generate immense wealth for all Canadians. Recently there has been a pivot to new types of subsurface resources, which include what are called critical or strategic minerals. Among these are lithium (from oilfield brines) and helium (found trapped within deep strata overlying Precambrian structural highs). Lithium demand is rising worldwide and is expected to increase significantly by 2030 from current levels. This is primarily because of increased demand for energy storage applications using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Concurrently, the imminent closure of the United States Federal Helium Reserve in Texas in late 2021 requires the identification of new and secure sources of helium, which is used in cryogenic applications for MRI scanners, during the manufacture of semiconductor chips and to purge and pressurize the propulsion systems of missiles and rockets. The pivot to lithium is driven by forecasted steadily-increasing demand, whereas the search for helium is driven by a risk of decreasing supply in the future. Western Canada is well positioned to become a secure source for both of these elements, not only because of its favorable geology, but because exploration for and development of both lithium and helium in the subsurface leverages the knowledge, expertise and infrastructure that currently exists for oil and gas in the WCSB.

['Dob Staff'],9/15/2021,"No new wells were approved in British Columbia in August, as the province continues to work with the Blueberry River First Nations (BRFN) on a way to improve and modernize provincial processes that recognize and respect their treaty rights.

Earlier this summer, the B.C. Supreme Court found the provincial government breached the Treaty 8 agreement signed with the Blueberry River First Nations because it allowed development such as forestry and natural gas extraction without the community’s approval.

It found the province failed its treaty promise to maintain the nation’s rights to hunt, fish and trap without interference.

Blueberry River elected Chief Marvin Yahey says Treaty 8 First Nations are not opposing resource development on their lands, but want to ensure industry progresses in a responsible way to the benefit of all parties.

“Our treaty always contemplated balance,” he told a news conference in early July outside the B.C. Supreme Court. “We support the use of resources on the land in a responsible way that ensures they can continue. We are not against industry. If this is done right, then there is plenty of work for everyone.”

In a recent statement to the DOB, a spokesperson for the BC Oil and Gas Commission (OGC) said the province, as a starting point, is working with Blueberry River on an interim decision-making approach while they negotiate a longer-term approach.

“Until the Province and Blueberry River come to agreement on the interim approach, we expect decisions could take longer than usual as applications must be considered in light of the court’s finding of infringement of treaty rights,” the OGC spokesperson said.

“We recognize this process will take time while we work to create a more balanced path forward in the territory, one that provides stable economic activity and employment along with environmental sustainability and protection of Treaty 8 rights.”

This summer, the B.C. Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation cancelled the province’s July and August petroleum and natural gas tenure dispositions in consideration of the B.C. Supreme Court decision

In Q2 conference calls, several companies active in northeast B.C. mentioned the Blueberry River case, including Tourmaline Oil Corp., AltaGas Ltd. and ARC Resources Ltd., among others, noting they have good working relationships with the BRFN (see here and here).

Last August, 83 new wells were approved in B.C. and Tourmaline was the top licensee with 36 wells licensed.

Top licencees

Cenovus Energy Inc. was the top licensee of new wells in August 2021 (including experimental and oilsands evaluation holes), with 53 new permits. The Top 5 licensee list for the month was rounded out by Canadian Natural Resources Limited (26), Teine Energy Ltd. (19), Spur Petroleum Ltd. (18) and Tundra Oil & Gas Ltd. (also 18).

Over the first eight months of the year, there’s a tie in licensing between Cenovus and Tourmaline. Each operator has licensed 157 wells. CNRL has permitted 144 wells, followed by Crescent Point Energy Corp. (143) and Teine (126).

August licence stats

Overall, operators across the country licensed 373 wells last month compared to 256 wells authorized in August 2020 — an increase of 46 per cent.

Alberta licensed 223 wells in August, up 105 per cent from 109 permits in the year-prior period, while Saskatchewan authorized 132 permits during the month compared to 51 wells licensed in August 2020 (up 159 per cent).

Manitoba’s permit count increased to 18 from 12 a year ago.

Year-to-date licence counts

Over the first eight months of the year, a total of 3,104 wells across Canada have been permitted, up 40 per cent from last year’s tally of 2,225.

To the end of August, Alberta has licensed 1,820 new wells compared to 1,056 wells a year ago.

Saskatchewan has permitted 846 wells in the first eight months of the year compared to 726 a year ago, while B.C. has approved 321 wells to the end of August compared to 384 in the first eight months of 2020.

Over the first eight months of the year, Manitoba has licensed 110 new wells compared to 46 a year ago.

Operators across Western Canada licensed 249 oil and bitumen wells last month, up from 139 in August 2020. Over the first eight months of the year, 1,997 oil and bitumen wells have been permitted compared to 1,240 a year ago (an increase of 61 per cent).

In August, 70 gas wells were permitted in Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan compared to 93 last year. In the first eight months of 2021, operators in these three provinces have licensed 812 gas wells versus 739 gas permits in the comparable period last year (an increase of 10 per cent).

To the end of August, operators have licensed 2,751 horizontal wells, or about 89 per cent of the total wells authorized across Canada (excluding experimental wells), and up from 1,896 horizontal wells in January-August 2020 (87 per cent of total wells).

Producers licensed no oilsands evaluation holes in August, the same as last year. Operators have licensed only six oilsands evaluation holes in the January-to-August period versus 37 in the first eight months of 2020."
