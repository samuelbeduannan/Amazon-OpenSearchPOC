"Enbridge Has A ‘Big Head Start’ When It Comes To New Energies, Renewable Infrastructure, ESG Forum Hears | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The Enbridge Inc. executives leading new energy and renewables infrastructure efforts in the energy transition era believe the company has a “big head start with our midstream peers and our position to widen our lead,” the company’s recent ESG Forum webcast heard.
“Our goals going forward are to further differentiate our approach to new energy delivery while making accretive low-risk investments,” said Matthew Akman, senior vice-president, strategy, renewables and new energies.
“Strategically speaking at the highest level, we see our assets as a platform for renewables and new energies. We have a mature and co-ordinated approach to development across our company and our announcement [Sept. 28] to dedicate more resources to new energies only strengthens our execution,” he added.
“We’re excited by the future, and I’m personally looking forward to helping us realize the opportunities ahead.”
Akman said Enbridge is starting from a good spot and are already major players. He noted that the company has over five gigawatts of gross renewable capacity in operation today, consisting of both wind and solar, located across Canada, the U.S. and in Europe.
“We built this up gradually over 20 years with a constant eye on profitability, proving out technology and aligning our investments to our low-risk model. We’re taking that same approach today with new energies. Our early investments are building capabilities and competitive position, while earning revenues that are right down our commercial fairway,” he said.
“We’ll be moving 2.1 PJs [petajoules] of RNG by the end of 2023 — renewable natural gas — and we produce 18,000 kilograms of hydrogen now for injection into our gas utility, but could go 10-times higher if demand is there, which we think it will be.”
Given that, Akman said the company has already eliminated about two million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. And those efforts are expected to only ramp-up going forward.
“As you’re all aware, renewable power is the biggest platform for pure-zero GHG energy at Enbridge today. Many energy companies are just signing contracts with third-party renewable players for a portion of their electricity requirements. But we stand out with our scale, asset base and broad capabilities in developing, constructing and operating renewable power, including onshore wind and solar as well as offshore wind,” he said.
“As our asset base expands every year, so do our capabilities. Our development company, Maple Power Inc. [a joint venture between Enbridge and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board], over in Europe is working closely with our partners to construct offshore wind projects and develop new opportunities.… These are highly complex and large-scale projects requiring unique siting, permitting and construction expertise along with well-developed supply chains which we’ve been carefully building.”
According to Akman, offshore wind is a “more recent foray” for Enbridge but one that’s already achieved scale.
“Offshore wind capacity is forecast to triple globally by 2030 — so explosive growth. Our focus has been on Europe where we see solid fundamentals, good commercial underpinnings and aggressive targets set by government for renewables,” he said.
“We already have ownership interests and several operating facilities in Germany and the U.K., [and] are in the active construction on three more large-scale facilities with 1.4 gigawatts of capacity in France alone. Coming up, right behind that, we’re developing another three gigawatts in Europe with our partner, again, CPPIB.”
Akman said that an “emerging but exciting growth opportunity set” is in floating offshore wind, which he noted has the potential to open up a vast new renewable resource.
“We’re actively working on a pilot in a late-stage in the south of France, and expect to participate in an upcoming utility-scale opportunity on floating wind as well. By mid-decade, our goal is to have enough operating offshore wind capacity to power the equivalent of half a million homes,” he told the virtual audience.
“The renewable business will have a big hand in helping us achieve our emissions reductions goals, too. By self-powering our own pipelines with solar we can substantially cut our Scope 2 emissions, often while reducing our power bills at the same time and generating good returns on capital.”
Akman said that Enbridge already has three operating solar cell power projects and four more under construction, with more likely.
“Right behind that, we see near-term potential of 10 to 15 more facilities with ultimate capacity of several hundred megawatts in the near-term. Those are behind-the-meter plants; in other words, 100 per cent dedicated to our pump and compressor stations,” he said.
“In addition, over and above that, we have the capability and appetite to develop so-called front-of meter renewables that can power our assets, in part, while also providing zero emission energy to third-party customers.”
New energies focus
Malini Giridhar, vice-president, business development and regulatory, said the company’s innovation efforts in new energies “reduce the energy intensity of the energy we deliver” and offset third-party emissions.
“They also leverage the vast geographic footprint of our assets and support their continued use for decades to come. Our 24,000-kilometres of transmission pipeline in the U.S. and Canada, and 85,000 kilometres of distribution pipeline in Ontario, can get RNG and low-carbon hydrogen to the market,” she said.
“And [the company is] uniquely positioned for green and blue hydrogen and carbon capture, which can leverage our renewable power assets, storage and transmission capabilities.”
Giridhar said Enbridge’s asset footprint also “comes with enduring supplier and customer relationships” in North America’s major producing and consuming regions. And those partnerships are vital.
“Aggregating our customers ESG goals with our own goals can provide significant scale. And add to this our demonstrated project execution skills, our strategic technology partnerships and stakeholder relationships and we believe we have all the necessary elements to be successful,” she said.
“Now we see investment opportunities across the value chain for both RNG and hydrogen within the Enbridge value framework, and many of these opportunities will come organically from the need to inject into our pipeline system from which we can then extend both upstream and downstream.”
In terms of RNG, Giridhar said the natural extension for the company is related to upgrading facilities, “because we are the custodians of gas quality on our pipelines.”
But, she added, Enbridge can move “further upstream into biogas production or landfill gas capture” and assess potential opportunities for fit with the company’s low-risk commercial model.
“Now, the technology is proven but adoption will take time as costs remain high,” Giridhar said.
“And in terms of opportunity set, we project that RNG from waste can be three per cent or more of Canada-U.S. demand, or one tcf by 2040 off a base of 80 bcf today. RNG can have emissions reduction potential beyond pure fuel substitution, particularly when it reduces fugitive emissions from landfills and agricultural sites,” she added.
“At a high level we expect that the three per cent blend of RNG in supply can result in a nine per cent reduction in fugitive emissions. Likewise, on hydrogen, too, we can move upstream beyond injection and blending facilities.”
On green hydrogen, Giridhar said Enbridge can move upstream to building electrolysis assets and even co-locate these with the company’s renewable assets. “And on blue hydrogen we have the transportation and storage capabilities.”
She said the company believes hydrogen could make up seven per cent or more of natural gas demand by 2040, but it can also address a number of energy challenges at the same time.
“Namely, it’s a backup to intermittent renewable generation providing reliability [and] it’s a solution to peak winter demand currently served by gas infrastructure and decarbonizing heavy industry,” Giridhar said.
“The takeaway here is that our diversified asset base across conventional and renewable assets, with last-mile connections to customers, will be absolutely key to enable low-carbon fuels. Now there are still some technical challenges to overcome and the costs need to come down further. But we are very excited about the opportunity.”
When it comes to hydrogen and RNG, Giridhar said that since the company’s first foray into RNG in 2011 it has brought three projects into service and it is executing four projects for in-service in 2022 and 2023.
“We have over 50 non-binding expressions of interest within our utility franchise which indicates significant developer interest and 10 to 15 projects in development currently,” she said.

She noted that Enbridge is developing partnerships that will generate even more investment opportunities.
“One example is our partnership with Walker Industries and Comcor [Environmental], which brings together their relationships and technical expertise in building and operating landfill sites with our expertise in gas processing, injection and delivery systems and in the marketing of natural gas,” Giridhar said.
“The partnership will initially prioritize the 40 existing landfill relationships that our partners are bringing.”
Giridhar added that the company’s recently announced partnership with Vanguard Renewables will also see opportunities surface across Enbridge’s gas transmission asset base.
“We have eight projects initially generating up to two bcf per year of RNG. But many other potential sites identified will be developed over the next five years. And this creates a nice opportunity set for growth through this partnership,” she said.
“And our foray into green hydrogen production and blending is a good example of how we identify and incubate an idea, pilot and then deploy.”
CCUS goals
Giridhar said “there’s no doubt” that carbon capture and storage will be imperative as North America, indeed the world, strives to achieve its collective GHG emissions reductions targets.
“Energizing the world with zero-carbon fuels and renewables cannot logistically happen fast enough to hit the two degree scenario or better. Large-scale CCUS will be critical to meeting our goals. And the good news for us is that it will become a big infrastructure investment opportunity,” she said.
“Forecasts suggest that CCUS could grow from a $1 billion industry today to over $1 trillion by 2050. But what will really drive that investment is a price on carbon and whether that’s established by governments and/or the private sector. Carbon markets will become more transparent and liquid over time, which will underpin the economics of these capital investments.”
Giridhar said Enbridge has the expertise in transport, as well as storage of energy products, and “we’ve also been a trusted infrastructure service provider to large emitters for decades.”
She said the company will use these advantages and build on them to develop a “large presence” in CCUS over time.
“And we’ll add new elements to our capabilities including best-in-class technology to compete and win. Our partnership with Svante [Inc.], which has a major capital cost advantage in carbon capture in the emerging market as well as several large-scale infrastructure development opportunities, is a good example of how we’ll approach CCUS development,” Giridhar said.
The bottom line? While the energy transition “will take time and won’t happen overnight,” Giridhar reiterated that Enbridge believes it is “ahead of the curve and will continue to capitalize on our scale to seek exciting growth opportunities in this space.”

Proposed Compressed Air Energy Storage Project Seen As Catalyst For Renewable Energy | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
After working with Cold Lake oilsands producers for more than a decade, Jordan Costley, engineering manager for privately held Federation Engineering, had a pretty good understanding of area reservoirs and utility infrastructure.
The Calgary and Bonnyville-based design-build firm is now putting that expertise to work. It is proposing a compressed air energy storage project to provide long duration (up to 48 hours) energy storage, balancing fluctuating Alberta power supply and demand with the growth in renewable energy.
The proposed Marguerite Lake project near La Corey, southwest of Cold Lake, also would provide ancillary services to the Alberta Interconnected Electric System (AIES).
Costley was familiar with local reservoirs, including the 200-metre thick Lotsberg halite at a depth of 1,100 metres. “I knew we had very, very good salt deposits here in this area and so energy storage came to mind,” he said in a recent interview.
 “The Marguerite Lake substation happens to be sitting on the best salt formation and that's key for compressed air energy storage,” said Costley. “It's really perfect . . . it’s very deep and it’s very clean and we know that there's lots of salt caverns that have been developed in it [for oilfield waste].”
With compressed air storage, electric motor driven compressors are used to capture from the electrical grid the excess energy generated by renewables, storing the compressed air underground. Then, during hours of higher demand, the compressed air is withdrawn from storage, heated and routed to expansion turbines to generate electricity which goes back on the grid.
“You're taking a lot of electrical energy and turning it into mechanical energy,” he said. “And then you essentially reverse that if you want the power back on the grid.”
When the price of electricity falls as renewables are brought online, Federation would take power off the grid for storage and then return it to the grid as renewables come off and the price rises.
 “So it's just energy time shifting because wind and solar don't always produce at the right times of the day, you need another way to supplement it,” he said. While typically additional power is provided by peaking generation plants, according to Costley they are inefficient in terms of the amount of fuel burned for the power produced.
Costley said he hopes the project will encourage the development of more renewable energy in Alberta. “If you look at the AESO [Alberta Electric System Operator] project list, it's wind, solar, wind, solar and more wind, solar, which is fantastic,” he said. “So I hope our project complements theirs and it's a kind of a catalyst to bring more and more renewables online.”
Washing the cavern could take several years but once that is complete, based on the depth, it would have a storage capacity of about 500,000 cubic metres at 20,000 kPa. “That gives us 48 hours of energy storage at full capacity, which is significant,” said Costley. (The United States Department of Energy considers anything more than 10 hours long duration. Lithium batteries which can economically store energy for up to four hours are considered short duration).
At present, there are only two proven technologies for long duration energy storage: compressed air and pumped hydro, which is the more common. Turning Point Generation already has regulatory approval for the Canyon Creek project, a planned pumped hydro energy storage facility near Hinton, Alberta. Costley said he is not aware of any other compressed air storage projects in Alberta, although one has been operating in McIntosh, Alabama since 1991 and another in Huntorf, Germany since 1978.
The first phase of Federation’s proposed storage project would consist of a single 125-megawatt compressor train (charge) and two 160-megawatt expander trains (discharge) with an estimated price tag of $400 million. The target in-service date is Sept. 30, 2025.
Siemens Energy would provide the majority of the surface equipment for the proposed project. The site provides a perfect match for the Siemens Energy SXT-800 compressor and expander technology which is specifically designed for compressed air up to 20,585 kPa, according to Costley. The compressor trains can ramp up compression by 30 per cent per minute, achieving a full load in four minutes, allowing rapid change in response to fluctuation in available power, which is well suited to intermittent power.
 Each expansion train can produce between 16 megawatts and 160 megawatts of power with a 20 per cent ramp up per minute. The plant can achieve full generation in less than 10 minutes of a request for dispatch.
The AESO in its 2021 long-term outlook notes that energy storage technologies have gained momentum in Alberta and are expected to continue to contribute to the operation of the power grid into the future. In its Clean Tech scenario, AESO forecasts there will be 1,520 megawatts of total storage capacity, including 75 megawatts of pumped hydro storage, by 2041. Storage is expected to exploit energy arbitrage and ancillary service opportunities, according to the report.
AESO currently is working with stakeholders on an energy storage roadmap as to how it can adjust the tariff structure to allow energy storage to compete in the marketplace, said Costley. “So we're of course watching that as that will make a big effect on the economics and the timing of the project.”
 Federation has already submitted applications to Alberta Energy and Alberta Environment and Parks for sub-surface and surface leases and to AESO for system access service. It also will need an approval from the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC).
“We felt we had identified a great opportunity as far as this project site location so we really kind of wanted to jump on the opportunity and start advancing through the regulatory process,” he said. “We have the power infrastructure, we have highway access and we have the salt formation.”
Federation currently is finalizing the project economic model/forecast and soon will be soliciting potential project development partners.

Refiner Phillips 66 Weighs Broader Move Into Electric Vehicle Batteries | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Phillips 66 is weighing a broader move into developing battery components for electric vehicles and storage systems, according to top executives, leveraging its own and others' research.
Phillips 66, which gets the bulk of its profits from processing oil into gasoline, diesel and petrochemicals, has become one of the largest supplies of a graphite used to make a key component in electric vehicles. It recently formed an ""emerging energy"" unit to explore new markets for hydrogen and low-carbon fuels.
""The U.S. refining business in the future is going to be smaller, not bigger,"" chief executive Greg Garland told reporters at its headquarters on Monday.
Battery research and partnerships would pivot beyond its small but lucrative materials business. Phillips 66's existing business — supplying materials for companies building graphite anodes for EV batteries — has been valued at more than $1 billion. The anode is about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of a lithium-ion battery's cost.
""We want to play a larger role in the value chain,"" said chief operating officer Mark Lashier. ""We are still looking at the entire chain and how to best integrate that.""
Lashier, who holds a PhD in chemistry, became Phillips 66's second-in-command in April after running the Chevron-Phillips Chemical joint venture since 2017. The company also is building EV charging and hydrogen refueling stations in Europe.
""There is going to be a battery supply chain in North America, a battery supply chain in Europe,"" said Garland. ""That's an opportunity for us: To take a raw material competitive advantage and lever that further down the value chain in batteries.""
Phillips 66 this week said it invested $150 million to buy a 16 per cent stake in Novonix Ltd., an Australian company that processes refinery byproducts into synthetic graphite for EV batteries.
Earlier it struck a technology deal with U.K.-based Faradion Ltd. to develop materials for sodium-ion batteries, another type of advanced batteries for energy storage and back-up power.
The agreements give Phillips 66 insight into key battery developments that it can use to build its business, said Lashier.

"Battery Metals Supply Chain Presents Significant Opportunity For Canadian Industry, Says New BMAC Report | Daily Oil Bulletin ","

Surging demand for lithium-ion batteries to power electric vehicles (EVs) and for energy storage applications could drive major economic growth across Canada, says a new report from the Battery Metals Association of Canada (BMAC).
The BMAC report, entitled Maximizing Canada’s Battery Metals Sector, looks at how Canada can build a thriving “mines to mobility” supply chain to capture this growing opportunity.
Based on a virtual workshop held in late March that brought together leaders from all segments of the battery metals supply chain, the report examines current and potential markets in mining, chemical production, battery components, battery cell manufacturing, end-use applications, and recycling. It also presents views from workshop participants on the barriers to growing each segment of the supply chain, along with potential solution pathways to overcome these barriers.
Demand for production from all segments of the supply chain is expected to grow exponentially, according to the World Economic Forum. Raw material demand for critical metals is expected to grow by a factor of 6-24 by 2030 depending on the metal. Demand for refining and processing is expected to grow 14-fold in the same period. The battery components market is expected to expand 15- fold, with cell production growing 19-fold. Recycling capacities will increase by a factor of more than 25.
The growth in demand across the supply chain has the potential to create annual revenues of $300 billion in 2030, an eight-fold increase from today.
Canada has all the necessary ingredients to capture a share of this market, according to the BMAC report.
Canada is a global leader in mining and has resources of all key critical minerals. Some of the major challenges to build out supply include the often-remote locations of new resources, long exploration and development lead-times, access to capital, and regulatory challenges.
The country is already a leader in refined nickel production and is working to increase its capacity for cobalt, graphite, lithium, and other rare earth element processing with plants in the planning stage. These facilities will be able to directly supply cathode and anode manufacturers as the next value-added stage of the battery supply chain.
Asia currently dominates the battery cell manufacturing space with nearly 80% of the global manufacturing capacity. However, Canada has made recent advances in cell manufacturing. Lion Electric, a manufacturer of all-electric trucks and buses, is currently building a $185 million battery manufacturing plant and innovation center in Quebec that will allow the electrification of approximately 14,000 medium and heavy-duty vehicles annually.
GM, Ford Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all committed to building EVs in Canada, with the sum of their announced investments totaling $5.75 billion. It also has several domestic EV manufacturers.
Canada also has numerous companies engaged in battery recycling. Li-cycle is ramping up to build the largest lithium-ion battery recycling plant in North America with a network of hubs to increase capacity to serve North American, European and Asian markets.
Building on this technology base across the supply chain is going to require lots of expertise, says Jim Parsons, VP of Business Development for Spartan Controls, a sponsor of the BMAC workshop and report. Spartan has a long history as a supplier of technology solutions to the oil and gas industry. Parsons says it can play a similar role in helping move the battery metals sector forward.
“We joined BMAC because battery metals are critical to decarbonizing.  Accelerating growth and success in this nascent Canadian industry will require partners who can bring modern, sustainable capabilities and expertise,” he says. “It wasn’t long ago when a new type, of energy production growth took off in Alberta; we supported emerging companies commercializing operations then, and we feel a responsibility to bring that expertise to this important new industry.”
Caralyn Bennett, executive vice-president and chief strategy officer of GLJ Ltd., shares this perspective. GLJ Ltd. provides a variety of technical information and consulting services to help the oil and gas and mining sectors identify and evaluate opportunities, improve business strategies, and attract sustained investment. Bennett says GLJ plans on working with the battery metals sector to speed its development and ensure it competitiveness.
“GLJ is excited to be part of the grassroots development of the Canadian battery metals industry,” she says. “Canada’s prolific natural resources and talented workforce position all of us for success. We look forward to working with our clients to de-risk their resource assessments and feasibility studies, aimed at accelerating their path to success.”
BMAC will build upon workshop results to help amplify and connect voices across the Canadian supply chain and to advance a vision for the battery metals industry, from mining to end use and recycling.
Sponsors of the workshop were: E3 Metals, Fluor Canada, GLJ Inc., Matrix Solutions, McCarthy Tétrault, and Spartan Controls.

TC Energy Reaches Agreement With National Defence To Develop Proposed Pumped Storage Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
TC Energy Corporation has reached agreement with the Department of National Defence that, subject to conditions and regulatory approval, allows for the development of a transformative 1,000-megawatt clean energy storage project on federal lands.
The Ontario Pumped Storage Project, proposed to be constructed on Department of National Defence’s 4th Canadian Division Training Centre property by TC Energy, would be Ontario’s largest energy storage project, optimizing the province’s electricity system and is estimated to deliver more than $250 million in annual savings to electricity consumers.
A multibillion-dollar private sector investment, over the next eight years, the project would result in approximately 1,000 jobs during development and construction. Once operating, it would provide emission-free electricity for the province, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an expected 490,000 tonnes — the equivalent of removing 150,000 cars from Ontario roads.
TC Energy will continue to consult with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation and other Indigenous rightsholders and communities, and engage with local communities and other interested stakeholders to assess potential impacts and economic benefits as the company advances the next phase of project development — including provincial and federal environmental and impact assessments.
Advancement of the project remains subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the company’s board of directors, regulatory approvals, and assurances that the project would not impact military activities and training.

New B.C. Clean Energy Centre Invests In Tech Such As CCUS; Shell Canada Offers Its Support | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The federal and British Columbia governments, as well as Shell Canada Limited, are committing $35 million each towards a new B.C. Centre for Innovation and Clean Energy, collaborating to decarbonize the economy and scale up clean energy.
The centre is scheduled to launch in autumn 2021.
“We need meaningful action not just today, but every day as we go forward, for this generation and future generations to meet the challenges of moving from a future that is less reliant on fossil fuels and more focused on clean innovative changes to how we do business — not just here in British Columbia and in Canada, but indeed around the world,” Premier John Horgan told a news conference Friday morning.
He added: “We have massive issues to deal with, and the only way we’ll find solutions is if we’re all in it together. Today is a step forward for B.C. and Canada to say to industry, not-for-profits and post-secondary institutions: ‘We’re ready to go. Are you?’ They are, and we can now start to do the incubation.”
Federal funding will go towards the centre’s innovative projects, while provincial and Shell’s funding will leverage additional public and private-sector investments and participation.
“It’s heartwarming to hear the commitment to workers, the commitment to livelihoods, and the commitment to do something about climate change,” said Susannah Pierce, president and country chair, Shell Canada. “We’ve seen the devastating impacts of the pandemic, but we’ve also seen the devastating impacts of climate change today, which is why bold, urgent action [is needed] by government, industry such as ourselves, and all of us.”
Established as a member-based, non-profit corporation operating independent from government and private entities, the centre’s initial focus areas for funding and project delivery will include carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), the production, use and distribution of low-carbon hydrogen, biofuels and synthetic fuels (including marine and aviation fuels), renewable natural gas, and battery technology, storage and energy management systems.
The centre will bring together innovators, industry, governments and academics to accelerate commercialization and the scale-up of provincial-based clean-energy technologies. The centre will also be a catalyst for new partnerships and world-leading innovation to deliver near-term and long-term carbon emission reductions.
Further, the centre will initiate new technology pathways to accelerate larger reductions on the path to net-zero emissions by 2050. Its intent is to attract a wide range of companies and partners that share a common focus on low-carbon innovation and scaling up B.C.-based clean-energy technology.
“It is our hope that this centre for innovation and clean energy will act as a catalyst, accelerating transformative changes within the province and energy system in targeted areas that support the B.C. government’s CleanBC plan,” Pierce said, adding there is a critical opportunity to invest in new technologies, partnering with government, industry, academia, rural and Indigenous communities, consumers and environmental groups to combat climate change.
“We are challenging other likeminded businesses and companies to join us to maximize the diversity and impact of this centre. More than ever, we must work together to help accelerate climate solutions that scale across society.”
As part of Budget 2021 and delivered through Natural Resources Canada’s Energy Innovation Program, the federal contribution to the centre will advance clean-energy technologies that help Canada meet its climate change targets.
“Our government is committed to reducing Canada’s emissions while, at the same time, creating good quality jobs and building a greener, more resilient economy,” said Carla Qualtrough, federal minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion. She added: “This centre reflects our government’s own vision for investing in new technologies and cleaner fuels that will deliver our low-carbon future.”
The centre also is part of the StrongerBC for Everyone Recovery Plan — a plan that aims to protect people’s health and livelihoods while supporting businesses and communities. According to Horgan, a centre location could potentially be at UBC or Simon Fraser University, particularly at the Surrey campus. “Over the next weeks and months, we’ll be working on where we’re going to be, who the board will be, and how many partners we’ll have.”

Quidnet Energy And ERA Partner To Develop Energy Storage Resource | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Quidnet Energy and Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), with funding from the Alberta government, have launched a project to develop an ultra-low-cost, multi-gigawatt (GW) geologic energy storage resource in Alberta, using Quidnet’s modular pumped hydro storage technology.
Quidnet said the Alberta project, which takes a step toward reliable renewable energy in the province, is a key part of its mission to accelerate decarbonization by developing and deploying similar-scaled geologic storage resources in major wholesale electricity markets throughout North America.
The project has received $5 million in funding from ERA and will take place at Quidnet's geologic test site in Brooks, Alta.
Quidnet’s geomechanical pumped storage (GPS) technology stores energy in the form of water compressed between layers of shale and enables renewable energy projects to store excess energy for extended periods of time, to be released when the grid needs power.
The company’s technology provides balance to the grid and optimizes utilization of transmission infrastructure for delivering renewable generation to load centers for grid decarbonization, it said.
“Renewable power resources, such as solar projects, work best when their output can be stored until the grid needs it,” said Joe Zhou, CEO of Quidnet Energy CEO. “Quidnet Energy's modular pumped storage technology provides the long-duration energy storage that can make widespread use of renewable resources reliable and effective.”
Steve MacDonald, CEO of ERA, said: “Quidnet’s technology is building on the innovation and technical expertise of Alberta’s oil and gas industry to help solve a key challenge with renewable energy: the need for reliable and long-term energy storage. This project is another example of Alberta taking action to develop the solutions the world needs to achieve its emissions reduction goals.”
Quidnet is developing energy storage projects in Texas, Ohio and New York .
With per-kilowatt installed costs projected at less than 50 percent of batteries and traditional pumped storage, the Quidnet Energy systems can be configured for applications with 10-hours or more of storage duration, it said. The modular design allows it to be scaled to the needs of specific projects and built on a diverse array of terrain.
“Quidnet’s GPS technology is a novel form of hydroelectric energy storage. It uses time-tested well-drilling and construction technologies to pump water under pressure into subsurface geologic formations to store energy. When the stored energy is needed, the water is released to drive hydroelectric turbines to power the electric grid,” Zhou explained.
With successful completion of the project, Quidnet would look to deploy GPS facilities across the Alberta power grid, including near solar and wind power facilities.

ARC Financial Announces Expanded Investment Mandate For ARC Energy Fund 9 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
ARC Financial Corp. announced today that it is expanding and diversifying the investment mandate of its most recent fund, ARC Energy Fund 9, to include companies pursuing energy transition.
With over 30 years of experience investing across the energy spectrum, ARC and its research institute have developed a unique method for understanding the landscape for energy transitions and have a track record of investing in renewables and clean energy technology companies dating back to 2000, it said.
ARC is currently engaged in evaluating a number of opportunities in biofuels, renewables development, energy storage and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and also anticipates raising capital for a dedicated energy transition-focused fund in the future.
“In addition to our existing focus on traditional oil and gas, our investing activities are broadening to again capture companies that emphasize decarbonization and environmental sustainability,” said Brian Boulanger, CEO of ARC Financial. “We view energy transition as an expansion of the opportunity set we know well, with the potential for strong returns across a more diversified investing universe. Our expanded focus will be on financing growing companies, both within Canada and across North America.”
ARC said it is committed to pursuing investments in the traditional oil and gas space, as global demand persists and traditional fuels will continue to support and enable the transition to a net-zero emissions based energy system. Both areas are presenting attractive opportunities for ARC’s capital and expertise.
“The net-zero-by-2050 imperative has governments, financial institutions and corporations pushing for wholesale change to develop new, low-carbon pathways,” added Peter Tertzakian, deputy director of the ARC Energy Research Institute. “In 2020, capital spending into renewables and electric vehicles exceeded global capital spending for traditional oil and gas for the first time. This trend will continue, and ARC is positioned to leverage its experience and expertise to identify and capitalize on the compelling opportunities.”

Canada Infrastructure Bank To Invest In Oneida Energy Storage Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) will invest up to $170 million in the half-billiondollar Oneida Energy Storage project in southwestern Ontario.
Under the terms of the investment agreement in principle, Oneida Energy Storage LP, together with private sector lenders, will finance the balance of the project's capital cost, which will be confirmed and announced at financial close this summer. Construction is anticipated to begin in fall 2021.
The project will help Ontario reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4.1 million tonnes, or the equivalent of taking 40,000 cars off the road every year. It will also allow Ontario to better manage peak electricity demand and meet future reliability needs in a more sustainable way.
When operational, the energy storage facility will draw and store existing surplus baseload and renewable energy during off peak periods. Clean, reliable power would be released to the Ontario grid when energy demand is at its peak to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, the facility will help optimize Ontario's electricity sector by providing important grid balancing services and reducing renewable curtailment. 
Oneida Energy Storage LP, a partnership between NRStor Inc. and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation, will create internship opportunities for Six Nations community members and result in training and employment opportunities.
Oneida Energy Storage LP will be responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the 250 megawatt / 1,000 megawatt-hour facility.

Avatar 2021 Exceeds ‘Wildest Expectations’ As Program Benefits Participants and Industry Alike | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
By approaching the energy transition as a massive opportunity for the oil and gas industry, the Avatar program has been able to pick up as a movement, says its founder, with young professionals thriving on encouragement and support towards tackling the biggest, most exciting energy projects and environmental solutions facing the modern world.
“When you pivot your thinking to look at the future of the energy sector in that light, you see a bright future,” Kevin Krausert, chief executive officer and co-founder of Avatar Innovations Inc., told the Bulletin. He said solutions for the most difficult areas to decarbonize exist within the oil and gas industry. “Whether that’s carbon capture and storage, hydrogen or long-duration storage, those are things the industry does very well.”
In terms of why Avatar has developed so much industry interest, he added, it is in part because when there is no proven pathway to net zero, the energy sector requires collaboration and “outside-the-box thinking and engaging” to forge new pathways. “That’s one of the reasons it has resonated so well with industry.”
For the most recent iteration of the Avatar program, noted Krausert, 98 per cent of 270 participants indicated in a survey that they found the program either highly or very valuable, exceeding organizers’ expectations.
“We’ve certainly struck a chord and generated a tremendous amount of enthusiasm around our next steps. In terms of differences from previous iterations, obviously this was by far the largest. The previous largest Avatar program was 54 people, and so 270 was a massive growth. It speaks to the excitement the industry has around looking at the energy industry in new ways, and collaborating in new ways.”
Doa Mousa, a 34-year-old specialist in business development at Enbridge Inc., was one of the participants in the recent Avatar program. She said it was a mind-opening experience, touching on many important aspects of the industry, such as Indigenous reconciliation, and there were presentations on various technology innovations in oil and gas.
“Having this new perspective definitely brings value to my employer. Also, everyone who participated came out with a completely different mindset about the future of our industry. We’re prouder to work in the oil and gas sector.”
For Olivia Dobek, 25, an engineer-in-training at TC Energy Corporation, the Avatar program challenged her to reconnect with the reasons she became a mechanical engineer in the first place — to innovate in the energy sector. She believes her employer certainly will benefit from sending participants to the Avatar program, as the program inspires participants to find innovation opportunities at work and revitalize their passion for the energy industry.
Dobek plans to seek opportunities within TC Energy and the broader industry to add value and promote innovation. “The program has also allowed me to see that change can be made on all levels if you have the willingness to connect with individuals that have a passion for innovation.”
Suncor Energy Inc. nominated 37-year-old Emmanuelle Plante, senior advisor, regulatory affairs, as one of its employees to attend the recent Avatar program. The subject of energy transition fascinates her professionally, she said, and the Avatar program proved to be an exceptional means of exploring this topic more thoroughly.
“For several weeks, we had two-hour conferences [once a week] with many diversified and motivating speakers, and there was also team work we had to do in an academic-like project. It was all in energy transition.”
Mousa’s role at Enbridge focuses on advancing low-carbon opportunities, which is an area of great interest for her. She said Avatar presented an opportunity to connect with industry leaders to learn different perspectives on the energy transition, whether it is from within the industry or through external stakeholders. “Throughout the program, I had an opportunity to meet some brilliant and dedicated individuals.”
She added: “In general, I found the quality and variety of sessions we had over the eight-week period to be really outstanding. The session really gave us many things to look forward to. We heard from industry leaders, technology experts, from policymakers, academics and entrepreneurs.”
Shark tank matters
The ‘shark tank’ experience proved to be a key feature of Avatar, participants told the DOB, with the various teams having an opportunity to pitch innovative business plans based on the ideas explored during the program.
“One of the great strengths of the Avatar program is its diverse approach,” said Dobek. “Each team, for example, had very unique members with all sorts of different backgrounds, skill levels and expertise, ultimately leading to some transformational discussions and huge learning opportunities.”
Avatar participants were placed into teams tasked with solving and building business cases for 10 pressing energy challenges involving carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and secondary carbon markets, methane emissions reductions, hydrogen, nature-based climate solutions, renewable natural gas and sustainable fuels, digitization, energy advocacy and policy long-duration storage, geothermal, as well as bitumen beyond combustion.
Plante’s group built its business case around the CCUS theme. All the members on her team brought unique skills to tackling the topic, she said. For example, Plante’s work in regulatory affairs gives her understanding of greenhouse-gas regulations. Even though her team did not make it to the finals, she added, the process taught her about packaging such high-level presentations for work, while also giving her valuable insights into capturing and storing carbon.
“I know a little bit more now about CCUS and the winning conditions for it to be applied. I’ll be able to use the general energy transition information we heard in conferences and in our team to be a better engineer, and there could be opportunities to use this knowledge in potential Suncor in the future for CCUS projects.”
Teams developed business proposals and presented them to a panel of industry experts during shark tank sessions — one for each challenge and a final one where the top teams competed. On March 18-19, all 44 teams presented their project proposals to panels of judges within their respective categories. On March 26, the winners within each category presented their pitches to a senior-level shark tank of industry veterans, with a final winner selected.
As for the winning team, it proposed a transformational business solution using nature-based climate solutions, unlocking a major solution for the decarbonization of energy. All the top teams will see their ideas further explored.
Krausert said: “The best teams will go into a pretty rigorous accelerator this summer, where they can [develop] a minimum viable product, a rapid prototype, working with University of Calgary faculty to ensure that solutions are not just vetted by industry, but are proven by research and science to really generate some exciting stuff.”
Mousa’s team proposed an interactive “digital repository” for all the Avatar ideas, documenting them for eventual presentation to potential investors to help facilitate their development.
“We didn’t move to the final round, but I found the whole experience to be the real win for me — just by going through the shark tank and going through the preparation and all the feedback from the coach, the Avatar leadership program, and the comments from the sharks,” she said. “It was very valuable.”
For its shark tank pitch, Dobek’s team focused on installing shallow geothermal solutions for residential and commercial applications at zero upfront cost to the installer. The team was successful in moving to the final round of the program.
“We paired this with a unique financial structure to ultimately establish our business as viable, scalable, and a safe, green investment. In addition to this, we identified opportunities where we can reskill and upskill oil-and-gas workers for this industry.”
She added: “Unfortunately, we didn’t take home top prize, but we were invited to submit an application to Avatar’s accelerator program, we’re hopeful we’ll be participating the next phase.”
Late last year, Avatar Innovations launched the first innovation accelerator focused on supporting the development of so-called ‘clean technology’ and clean energy solutions. According to Krausert, the accelerator enhances the Avatar program, first of all, by making it a “true industry collaboration” with 67 oil and gas companies participating from eight provinces across Canada. It also puts financial structures in place to help generate and implement industry solutions.
Other program highlights
Avatar’s most recent iteration showcased many speakers, such as Marcius Extavour, executive director of the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, former senator Murray Sinclair, chair of Canada’s Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as George Whitesides, chief space officer of Virgin Galactic.
The session dealing with technology as a transformational business was a highlight for Mousa. She was inspired by what Whitesides told Avatar participants, as well as by his mere presence at the event. “It was surreal to be with him in the same virtual room, listening to his experiences, and having the opportunity to converse with him directly. And this was also the case for all the other speakers. I found that to be very inspiring.”
Among the speakers at Avatar that Plante enjoyed was Maggie Hanna, a fellow on the decarbonization team at the Energy Futures Lab, associate at Canadian Energy Systems Analysis Research (CESAR), and futurist. Hanna talked about different hydrogen types (i.e. blue, green and pink), and how different regions of Canada might have a preferred ‘colour’ based on their particular aptitudes.
“It was fun to see the overall picture for all Canada for the implementation of hydrogen,” she said, adding there were many inspiring presentations and discussions throughout the program.
Getting a diverse, comprehensive overview of where the energy industry currently stands, and how the industry can help Canada move towards net-zero, was a program highlight for Dobek. She went into Avatar admittedly not knowing too much about alternative energy industries and the possible future of oil and gas, and the program’s energy transition focus was beneficial for her professionally and for her own interest’s sake.
“I learned the future of energy is absolutely dependent on industries coming together and working towards a common goal of sustainability. I believe it’s not about abolishing any one particular industry. If the approach isn’t interdisciplinary, then we really don’t stand a chance.”
She added: “I’ll definitely be looking out for innovation opportunities within TC Energy, seeking avenues to better educate myself on Indigenous reconciliation, and ultimately being a champion in the energy transition conversation, all of which are priorities for TC Energy as well.”
For Krausert, the “infectious enthusiasm” of hundreds of young energy professionals — passionate, driven and committed to building a better future — was a highlight. “Obviously, there were some incredibly transformational technological solutions and business plans that were generated, and those were pretty exciting.”
Avatar next steps
In terms of future iterations of the Avatar program, organizers currently are building out a five-year plan, Krausert said, and they have a number of “exciting concepts” to develop, including the incorporation of some new technology partners. There is also a question of the program’s format and structure post-pandemic.
“Obviously, we’re contemplating what an in-person — or at least a hybrid — version of Avatar looks like as COVID-19 hopefully comes to an end sometime soon. We’re looking at a number of expansion opportunities.”
As for those young oil and gas industry professionals still hoping to participate in Avatar, Krausert told the DOB, the next iteration of the program likely will be either in Q4 2021 or Q1 2022. “We’ll have some exciting news coming in the next short while.”

Innovative Compressed Air Energy Storage Tech Scores Projects In Ontario And California | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
A long-duration energy storage solution that just received major funding support from the federal government and announced it will be working on the development of a major energy storage project in California borrows some of its processes from the petroleum industry. 
Hydrostor Inc.’s emissions-free Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology runs electricity through a compressor and stores potential energy in the form of compressed air underground. When the grid needs energy, the air is released into an air turbine that generates electricity.
“This grew out of the oil and gas sector,” says Jon Norman, president of Hydrostor, headquartered in Toronto.
“What we are doing is re-purposing very well known oil and gas processes and applying them for the purpose of long-duration energy storage,” he told the DOB. “This is particularly true of the compressors and air turbines that we use to take the off-peak electricity, store it, and run the air through the turbine and a heat exchanger.”
Last week, Hydrostor announced the development of 1,000 megawatts (MW) of long-duration energy storage in California in what is considered the largest compressed air grid energy storage project in the world.
While California has made major strides in renewable power generation — it recently, briefly, saw 94.5 per cent of its power draw fuelled entirely by renewables — it is now in need of utility-scale energy storage as it phases out fossil power plants and integrates more variable renewables. While battery storage systems have advanced considerably in recent years, they typically do not exceed four hours duration.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has identified a need for up to 1,600 MW of long-duration energy storage by 2026. “Long duration energy storage is critical to achieving California’s decarbonization and renewable goals,” noted Hydrostor.
With the announcement, Hydrostor now has two major projects in active development in the state — one in southern Kern County and one in Central California — capable of storing up to 10 gigawatt hours of energy and representing a combined investment of over US$1.5 billion.
Hydrostor, which recently opened an office in the San Francisco Bay Area, has been actively advancing its projects since 2017 to be ready for the state’s procurement initiatives, expanding its team and footprint in the state and participating in CPUC proceedings advocating for long-duration storage.
How it works
Hydrostor’s system acts like a mechanical battery but with a longer-term performance than conventional options. “We can store that energy indefinitely and provide a solid amount of discharge onto the grid for four hours, eight hours, 12 hours, 20 hours or more, depending on what a utility requires,” says Norman. “That is very different than when you hear about battery systems on the electricity grid.
“Typically, they are providing a discharge that is between one and four hours, not longer than that, because they are not cost-effective for that purpose,” he adds. “We’re very well targeted to that application and that application is becoming really important in a lot of markets now.”
This is, in part, due to the closure of some natural gas-fired facilities. “You can’t just replace that capacity without being able to provide hours and hours of generating capacity,” says Norman. “Duration matters.”
While A-CAES operates like a pumped hydro storage resource, there are some key differences. “We are much less environmentally-impactful and we can flexibly locate, where a pumped hydro plant can’t,” says Norman.
Between the two, there is a modest trade-off in efficiency. The average for pumped hydro plants sits at around 70 to 80 per cent while A-CAES is around 60 to 65 per cent round trip between high-voltage AC systems.
“When you are providing this locatable capacity at that scale, with these types of rotating characteristics and so on, that is a good replacement to conventional power infrastructure,” Norman says, as this marks a “really slight increase in operating costs.”
Hydrostor’s system addresses some of the limitations by which traditional compressed-air energy storage is typically limited. For example, the heat created by the compression process is captured and stored in a proprietary thermal store to reheat the compressed air when energy is needed, bolstering round trip efficiency to the 60 per cent plus range compared to about 40 per cent for other systems. And the cooler compressed air requires less volume underground.
The storage volumes in conventional methods are such that the only cost-effective option for compressed-air energy storage is in salt caverns. “They can only locate it where these salt caverns exist, which is typically not where the grid requires it,” says Norman. “There are only so many applications for that.”
Rather than being restricted to salt caverns, Hydrostor is able to construct a cavity underground using techniques from the hydrocarbon storage industry. The company estimates around 70 per cent of all land has suitable geology for the system.
“We can do that cost-effectively because our process is so efficient that we don’t need as much volume,” Norman says. “When we develop projects at a 200, 300, 400 MW scale — which is typically what our pipeline is — it is very cost effective.”
Investing in cleantech
Hydrostor has an existing commercial project, the Goderich A-CAES facility in Goderich, Ontario, completed in 2019 with 1.75 MW peak power output that provides up to 12 hours of long-duration energy storage.
Natural Resources Canada’s Energy Innovation Program announced a $500,000 investment in Hydrostor’s energy storage system in April.
The $500,000 will go toward design of a 300-500 MW A-CAES facility in Ontario. In addition to funding of $1.6 million from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) in February and funds through Hydrostor and its partners, the project has about $4 million in support.
After some power plant shutdowns in Ontario, there’s been a need for generating capacity, says Norman, creating a perfect application for storage “because we are just taking that off-peak electricity and putting it into a peaking capacity asset they can use.”
Hydrostor has also kept its eye on the other end of the country. “We have always been interested in Alberta,” says Norman. “We think it has interesting math, potential for storage.”
The ability to build natural gas plants in Alberta, however, has prevented the province from being a market that fits as naturally as others do.
“There tends to be more urgency in markets like California where they can’t build gas plants,” Norman says. “They have really large renewable penetration, so we invest more money there.”
But the door remains open for Hydrostor in the prairie province. “I think our application has tremendous value to provide to the Alberta grid but they have to put the conditions in place that are going to allow that to happen,” says Norman. “We’re starting to talk to different partners in Alberta that are interested in developing it, but it is a bit earlier stage for us.”
 Hydrostor’s technology has captured the attention of several markets across the globe, including being tapped to provide a reliability solution for TransGrid, a major utility in Australia. In all, the company is advancing a pipeline of large-scale A-CAES facilities that represent over 2,000 MW and 20,000 MWh of near-term project deployment potential in Canada, the U.S., Chile and Australia.

Feds Provide Funding For Energy Storage | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The federal government announced a $500,000 investment in the development of Hydrostor Inc.’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology, a scalable and emissions-free long duration energy storage solution.
A-CAES has the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions by enabling the transition to a cleaner and more flexible electricity grid.
“Specifically, the low-impact and cost-effective technology will reduce the use of fossil fuels and will provide reliable and bankable energy storage solutions for utilities and regulators, while integrating renewable energy for sustainable growth,” said the government.
Hydrostor is working on optimizing its patented technology that improves upon traditional compressed air energy storage as it deploys its use on a commercial scale. This will increase the clean technology’s readiness for wider deployment and result in a flexible reference design that will apply to A-CAES facilities going forward.
This project is funded through Natural Resources Canada’s Energy Innovation Program (EIP), which advances clean energy technologies that will help Canada meet its climate change targets, while supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is done through investments in research, development and demonstration projects, as well as related scientific activities.

Charging Ahead: Battery Storage Technology Making Its Mark On Canadian Energy Sector | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Both for reliability and environmental purposes, oil and gas companies want to increasingly include renewables on their off-grid installations, which makes effective battery storage a necessary tool — an issue for which Québec-based EVLO Energy Storage Inc. has a safe solution.
“We already have this application deployed in Québec’s far north, and it’s probably one of the main applications that we can think of for oil and gas producers in Alberta,” Martin Rheault, vice-president of business development and interim chief technology officer, told the Bulletin. “They want to include renewables. At a certain point they’ll have to include a battery to manage the start and stop of the diesel engines, and to make sure they have stability.”
In December Hydro-Québec launched EVLO, a subsidiary that designs, sells and operates safe, efficient and sustainable energy storage systems that include power control and energy management software, and are intended mainly for power producers, transmission providers and distributors, as well as the commercial and industrial markets for medium-scale and large-scale storage.
EVLO’s proprietary lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell technology is based on 40-plus years of research and development on battery materials by Hydro-Québec, which holds more than 800 patents. The subsidiary’s systems are field-tested in actual operating conditions, including in the northern Quaqtaq off-grid system where these batteries function in extreme Canadian weather.
For remote oil and gas operations, according to Rheault, companies are designing more new facilities with the ability to integrate renewables and storage, which will make EVLO’s offerings even more applicable in the future. “Green” operations in the conventional energy space become more feasible thanks to storage, he said.
“[Alberta-based renewable developers] and other developers definitely are aggressive on the storage market, and they are all expressing interest in our technology,” Rheault added. “They have to look at every new solution coming to the market, and EVLO is another one of those.”
Wind energy storage
Meanwhile, in October TransAlta Corporation’s WindCharger battery storage project began commercial operations, representing Alberta’s first utility-scale, lithium-ion energy storage project, boasting a nameplate capacity of 10 megawatt and total storage capacity of 20 megawatt-hours.
WindCharger utilizes Tesla Inc.’s Megapack technology, which can fully charge in roughly two hours and will be powered by the TransAlta Summerview II wind farm near Pincher Creek. WindCharger does not require any new infrastructure investments as it is an entirely behind-the-meter project.
“There are two benefits [to behind the meter],” Aron Willis, senior vice-president, growth, told the DOB. “One is that we can always say the energy we’re dispatching out of the battery is ‘green’ energy, because it was generated at the wind farm.
“A second benefit is it’s much more cost [effective], because we don’t have to pay transmission and distribution charges that would be associated with importing that energy from the grid, if that’s what we chose to do.”
When the wind farm is running and generating, he said, TransAlta uses its renewable energy to charge the batteries, with a team in Calgary making decisions based on market signals to dispatch the energy out of these batteries. He added: “The battery also provides a level of reliability support for the system by participating in the ancillary services market as well.”
In order to choose the Tesla technology, TransAlta ran a competitive process, polling the market to understand the capabilities of different technologies, price points, and ability and willingness of manufacturers to provide warranties and capacity guarantees for technology over time. Willis noted that while this sort of energy storage technology is not easily swapped out for newer, better batteries, the technology has advanced so it can offer longer-term reliability.
“Will [storage technology] continue to improve? For sure. Are we going to be standing, looking back, next year, regretting the technology choice we made? Definitely not.”
Windcharger site layout
Building better batteries
EVLO says its LFP batteries are safer than conventional lithium-ion batteries, as their molecular structure provides intrinsic protection against thermal runaway. They also have a smaller environmental footprint, as they are made from naturally abundant, non-toxic materials, and also because they can be recycled using a process that allows 99-per-cent of active materials to be recovered and reused. Moreover, these batteries do not contain cobalt or rare-earth elements.
“The only loss that we have is the density,” said Guillaume Hayet, EVLO’s president and chief executive officer. “We need to put in a little bit more battery to have the same energy density [as conventional batteries]. When you have space and weight constraint as with an [electric vehicle], then you have an issue if you’re not willing to do the compromise of recharging more often. However, more and more people in China are accepting the compromise for the safety aspect.”
While the LFP battery does exist elsewhere in the industry, he added, EVLO’s parent company, Hydro-Québec, has created the majority of intellectual property for it. “We know the technology better than anyone else. We’re not the only player to produce LFP. Not all of them are respecting IP and have the licences. Obviously, we do. Not everyone has mastered this as much as we have.”
For its various benefits, EVLO recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with France’s Innergex énergie renouvelable inc. to participate in the Tonnerre project, which involves installing a nine-megawatt hour storage system for national transmission. The European system is slated for commissioning in 2021.
“We really believe in the technology, because we firstly never believed in unsafe storage,” Hayet said, adding there is an increasing demand for energy storage overall, particularly safe storage, and EVLO aims to capture a big portion of that demand. “In the last four to six months there has been a major increase in the demand for the safety of LFP. You’re seeing big players talking about it.”
Naturally, he noted, oil and gas companies are very interested in the safety aspect of LFP, because when it comes to an off-grid petroleum platform, safety is paramount. “The safety of LFP now is very valuable for these players.”
In terms of battery technology, LFP density by design is fairly plateaued, suggested Hayet, and so there will not be a step function improvement in density, short of some unforeseen research-and-development improvements. However, EVLO does foresee an improvement in the longevity of LFP batteries. “We’ll also do R&D for other technologies of the storage where we’re going to be able to increase the density, get the safety aspect, and also keep it high cycle.”
Benefits of lithium-ion battery storage
TransAlta intends to do more lithium-ion projects, according to Willis, as they are “suited to certain applications” and are quick responding. Further, lithium-ion’s price point is superior for storage durations of four to five hours or less. “Lithium-ion is probably going to win the day. We will do more lithium-ion projects.”
He added: “We’ll also look at other forms of longer-duration storage, including other types of chemical storage, and we also have a pump storage project in our fleet of potentials as well, a large Alberta project at our existing Brazeau hydro facility.”
The future will see more of the energy mix weighted to wind and solar, noted Willis, which will inevitably lead to more forms of storage technology in efforts to make renewables increasingly practical. Aside from chemical batteries, he highlighted pumped hydro, compressed-air storage and flywheels, among other options.
“An ability to store energy and deliver it when you need it is key to enabling higher and higher levels of intermittent renewable energy generation, on a network. TransAlta is active within many different spaces, areas of energy storage, monitoring technology development, working directly with customers to understand what applications are best suited to their business or where they have a need we could satisfy with a battery.”
Certainly, there are several researchers developing Canadian-sourced alternatives to some of the rare-earth elements currently being used for many conventional chemical batteries, he added. “At the end of the day, it’s a mix of technologies that provides optimal of the system overall.”
Oneida MOU
Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) and Oneida Energy Storage LP have signed an MOU for the Oneida Energy Storage project in Ontario, which confirms the bank’s support of the project. Oneida is a joint venture between NRStor Incorporated and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation.
The project will be confirmed by a final investment decision in spring 2021. The newly announced partnership is part of the CIB’s $10 billion Growth Plan, which includes delivering clean power infrastructure. The CIB has a goal of investing $2.5 billion in clean energy projects across Canada within three years.
It would draw and store existing surplus baseload and renewable energy during off peak periods. Power would be released to the Ontario grid when energy demand is at its peak. In addition, the energy storage facility would help stabilize Ontario’s electricity sector by providing grid-balancing services.
“Energy storage is a game-changer that can help to enable Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy and make Ontario a global leader in cleantech innovation,” Annette Verschuren, CEO and founder, NRStor, stated in a news release, adding Oneida will be one of many such storage projects in Canada. “We are excited to work with industry-leading partners on the Oneida project to deliver grid efficiencies at scale resulting in meaningful savings for ratepayers.”
TransAlta’s remote experience
TransAlta has a Western Australia business dedicated to providing power to remote mine sites, and so the firm is already quite experienced with the sorts of off-grid oil and gas applications that might be applicable within a Western Canada context, noted Willis. In running such operations with renewable energy, he said, storage is imperative.
“An ability to store that energy when you’re in a period of excess, and then use it or dispatch it out of the battery when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining, that is very key to picking up some renewable energy at those sites. That is certainly one key application.”
In addition, he told the DOB, there is an opportunity to apply batteries for oil and gas operations, even if purely from a reliability perspective for when there is an interruption in supply from diesel generators or even the grid.
“Even for some of the large grid-connected operations, as industry continues to seek more green power and more non-emitting sources of generation for power supply to their operations, batteries or energy storage generally offers an interesting solution there, where you could in a period of excess still consume the wind or solar energy by putting it in your battery instead of consuming it at your operations, dispatching when the wind isn’t blowing.
“There are a number of different applications, and we continue to work with many customers exploring those types of things as we look to provide those types of solutions to the industry here.”
Future for energy storage
Competition will come quickly to the energy storage space, suggested Willis. For its part, he said, TransAlta must continue to grow within this space as it works to maintain its position as Alberta’s largest electricity provider.
“Our focus is really on finding solutions with customers, frankly, in order to deliver a full solution for what they’re seeking, be it grid power supply or a renewable supply option, and where battery or energy storage technology supports that solution for the customer. That’s where we would be focusing our time and effort.”
TransAlta anticipates increasing battery storage opportunities as intermittent generation gets added to the grid, and a need for storage to support times when generation is not available grows. He added: “We expect to see continued use and deployment of this technology right across the country, over the next few years.”
For EVLO, it not only is working to stimulate integration through the provincial grid, noted Hayet, but the Hydro-Québec subsidiary is using its knowledge and R&D resources to help customers to integrate renewables and speed up the energy transition.
“Our commitment is to bring any new technology that will accelerate that transition or better it for the customers. We’ll push it to the market as fast as we can, and then we do have the knowledge on the global network to do that.”

"Eneon-Es Takes Tundra And Canadian Energy Expertise, Applies It To Battery Energy Storage | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Eneon-Es Inc. is focusing on the design and fabrication of large-scale, customized, turn-key battery energy storage systems, combining the expertise of two well-established companies aiming to recharge the energy sector.
“There’s significant opportunity for energy efficiency gains and reliability improvements in oil and gas,” Jason Beacock, director of business development, told the Bulletin regarding the value of battery storage technology for the incumbent energy sector. “Efficiency gains are the name of the game right now, and everyone is trying to drive down costs. Large-scale energy storage can absolutely support that. We can increase reliability of electricity to the facilities.”
He added: “If there’s generation at site, then [there is more] reliability and increased efficiency on the electricity side, reducing the GHG emissions from on-site generation by right-sizing that generation by having battery back-up. When we look at oil and gas, we’re trying to team together as many value propositions as we can so we can get as much value out of the systems for our clients as possible.
“Another thing we’re seeing, too, is renewable integration into oil and gas operations, which is interesting. Batteries give you an opportunity to bring in those renewables as well for site power.”
Calgary-based Tundra Process Solutions Ltd. and Canadian Energy formed a joint-venture to build on proven success of these firms’ partnership, providing world-class systems to North American clients. According to Beacock, while they officially launched Eneon-Es in August, the two companies were working on the joint-venture for at least two years. The new entity already has significant U.S. business with clients requiring battery storage for pipelines.
Eneon-Es is finalizing some micro-grid projects in Alberta and Northern Canada, he added, which altogether facilitated formation of the company to essentially focus on marketing efforts, as well as to build a team to improve energy storage. “The way it works is that we have a core team of engineers, integration and project-execution staff at Eneon, and we leverage the shared services of both our parent companies — Tundra and Canadian Energy.
“We also leverage the facilities from both organizations. And so, [those include] the extension fabrication facilities with Tundra, and the R&D testing lab in Markham, Ont., with Canadian Energy.”
Regarding the entity’s name, the ‘En’ is short for ‘energy’, and the ‘eon’ implies ‘limitless’ or ‘a very long time period,’ while the ‘Es’ is short for ‘energy storage,’ noted Beacock. With installations operating or planned across the continent, Eneon-Es management hopes to diversify and repurpose Alberta’s energy expertise, exporting world-class ‘made-in-Alberta’ technologies to the rest of the world.
Eneon-Es envisions lots of interest on the oil and gas space for its battery technology, suggested Beacock, as there is an opportunity to reduce electricity bills, optimize generation, gain resiliency from the grid, integrate renewables, and to provide remote power. In terms of the overall energy sector, he noted, both the provinces of Ontario and Alberta are and have the potential to be big users of battery energy storage.
“We’re seeing a lot of interest in the storage space. There already has been some really big battery energy storage implementations in [Alberta],” he said, adding that Canada is “on the precipice of a boom” in terms of renewables and energy storage. “The future is bright. One of the great advantages we have is that we also have access to some highly-skilled labour in the province of Alberta, and that’s one of the things we’re really proud of.”
Battery energy storage is really a new sector, Beacock told the DOB, and its adoption is facilitated by significant reductions in costs, as well as a rise in lithium ion battery energy density, thanks largely to the uptake or adoption of electric vehicles, as they use essentially the same batteries as the energy sector.
“With that cost being driven down, it’s really gotten battery energy storage to a point where it makes sense to be able to implement these technologies. Battery energy storage is the ‘missing key’ in the energy transition. This is [due to] the intermittent profile of renewable generation — i.e. wind and solar — as the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, but you need energy pretty consistently”
He added: “We need those batteries to be able to provide energy when those sources aren’t available. It stores those sources for when people need that energy.”
Building off oil and gas expertise
Eneon-Es brings extensive integration expertise and energy storage knowledge into the energy space. Tundra has been integrating complex electrical systems for more than a decade into North America’s oil and gas market, Beacock said, while Canadian Energy has 32 years of energy storage expertise. “We don’t see a lot of competitors in this space with that level of complexity in terms of integration and battery energy storage understanding.”
He added: “I’m extremely excited for the future. We’re so fortunate to be backed by two successful Canadian companies. I like to call us the ‘55-year-old start-up.’”
The new company can leverage many resources from the oil and gas sector, he told the DOB, repurposing many energy worker skills for battery storage purposes. “We have a great talent pool to pull from that’s directly correlated. Those skillsets that are here are a perfect fit for what we’re doing on the energy storage side. Having access to those skills is vital as we scale, and it’s a great position for us to be in.”
Eneon-Es is learning to optimize its systems and make them more intelligent, layering on complex software to get as much value out of these battery energy storage systems as possible.
“We had always wanted to bring our extensive project execution and fabrication experience to the battery storage systems world, but didn’t have the design and engineering experience within Tundra alone,” Eneon-Es president Ken Franklin stated in a news release.
He added: “As we started developing the relationship with Canadian Energy, it became clear that their 30 years of expertise in the battery energy world would be a perfect match to Tundra’s 21 years of integration excellence.”
Battery tech costs coming down
Battery technology has been around for a long time, but what has changed in recent years to make it more viable is the cost, said Beacock, and Eneon-Es is at the forefront of tailoring the technology for the energy sector. “We do offer fairly specific value propositions, such as our proprietary control system, the integration expertise, the best expertise, that’s really what’s different from what’s out there.
“There isn’t a lot of the long-term integration expertise around these complex electrical systems. That’s what has really set us apart — that and the fact we’re one of the only providers in Western Canada.”
He noted that Alberta is one of the most attractive jurisdictions in Canada for renewable integration onto the grid, just because of its open electricity market. “I came from oil and gas, members of our team came from oil and gas, and the resources we’re using, and the skilled labour we’re using, came from oil and gas.
“It’s such a great story to tell — taking the extensive expertise in energy that we have as a province and repurposing it into a new place.”

From Oilfield To EV: Petrolithium Could Hold Key To Creation Of Battery Manufacturing Sector | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
This is part of an ongoing DOB series, titled New Directions, New Possibilities, which examines energy innovation, sustainability challenges and opportunities. 


As the world sits on the precipice of a new low-carbon economy, built on renewable energy and energy storage, there may be few other countries as well positioned to take advantage of the transition as Canada. And one of the potential avenues to exploit the wave could be sitting in plain sight in Alberta’s oilfields.
Oil and gas are not the only prized substances pumped to the surface by tens of thousands of wells — many of which produce many times more wastewater than petroleum. Contained within that brine are other valuable commodities like heat energy and minerals — including lithium.
The vital ingredient in today’s most common rechargeable battery — making up about 10 per cent of a lithium-ion battery — the lightest metal is found in high enough concentrations in oil and gas well produced water to foster an early stage petrolithium sector based on direct lithium extraction technology.
Emergent production from Alberta oilfields (see Alberta Startups In Global Race To Grab A Piece Of Booming Lithium Supply Chain), and from hard rock mining in Eastern Canada, could be the lure to build a whole new sector devoted to lithium-ion battery production — a sector expected to explode with the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and utility scale energy storage.
And the higher up the supply chain ladder producers can climb — potentially even integrating with Canada’s existing auto sector as EVs become mainstream — the higher the value of the sector to the economy.
Not only does Canada possess the raw materials — in addition to lithium it is one of only two countries to possess exploitable deposits of all the materials required to produce cathodes, which account for roughly half of a battery’s value — but it possesses the prospect of producing the “greenest” lithium in the world.
But time is of the essence as more countries rise to the realization battery production is of strategic importance and move to establish their own presence in the sector. Fear of losing control over their own battery production, the French and German governments recently announced a major initiative to build European-owned battery factories in both countries — ones designed to “set new standards in their CO2 footprint,” according to a German government statement.
The two factories alone represent investment of about 4 billion euros ($5.74 billion). “We need to be able to produce our batteries; this is a matter of industrial sovereignty and the reduction of CO2 emissions,” French president Emmanuel Macron said. Auto companies like Volkswagen AG are investing billions in their own battery cell factories while also signing supply deals with major manufacturers like Panasonic Corporation and LG Chem.
Last June, McKinsey & Company said the predicted “dramatic increase in EV numbers means that the potential battery market is huge.” In Europe alone, it projects that by 2040 battery demand from EVs will reach a level to support 80 new “gigafactories,” supporting a battery cell market valued at 90 billion euro per year and the creation of about a quarter million jobs.
National plan
Canada is waking up to the opportunity as well. It launched an initiative last year to investigate “how increased economic activity could be generated across the value chain to position Canada as a globally competitive manufacturer of green battery metals and sustainable value-added goods made with them.”
In a draft report produced after consultation with industry, it recommends moving up the battery value chain to establish a leadership position in advanced battery production, stationary energy storage and battery recycling (a deluge of used batteries will hit the market later this decade as EVs reach end-of-life battery capacity).
“Canada has all the minerals and metals required to produce advanced batteries. Establishing a robust supply of these materials through exploration, mining and mineral processing will help attract investment further downstream in battery component manufacturing,” states the report, titled From Mines to Mobility: Seizing Opportunities for Canada in the Global Battery Value Chain.
Leveraging the presence of the raw materials could attract a leading battery manufacturer — which are few in number and mostly based in Asia — to Canada, which could act as an anchor to support both the growth of upstream materials production and downstream development of EV assembly and stationary storage technologies, it states.
“An electric vehicle assembly plant would bolster the future of Canada’s automotive industry while fuelling the growth of a domestic battery industry… Canada must embrace a strategic ‘mines to mobility’ approach if it is to be an integral part of the global battery industry.”

EVs driving rapid growth
It’s not just the meteoric rise in leading EV maker Tesla Inc. that is driving growth. Virtually every other major auto manufacturer has announced plans to shift to low- to zero-emission vehicles as costs fall and emissions regulations tighten. Numerous jurisdictions will ban the sale of internal combustion engine light vehicles in the next 15-20 years, including B.C. and several European countries, while tightening emissions regulations further incentivize EVs.
EVs represent about 70 per cent of the anticipated demand for lithium-ion batteries through 2030, with grid scale energy storage making up much of the rest. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts EV sales could soar to 43 million units per year by 2030, up from just two million in 2018, with production valued at more than US$567 billion annually. The supply of batteries will need to jump more than tenfold by 2030, according to BloombergNEF.
“EVs and in particular passenger electric vehicles are driving volume,” Adam Tuck, program leader – Energy Storage, National Research Council, told a recent workshop in Calgary, titled Alberta’s Lithium Ion Battery Supply Chain Opportunity. It’s not just Canada, he said, “it’s China, Europe, Australia, Japan, the U.S. Everybody is investing massively in this space. That’s the opportunity for us, because not all of these countries have the resources and the technologies required to implement this. This is the time we need to do something, and Canada has a number of inherent benefits and reasons why we should participate in this.”
Leading battery and automotive manufacturers are moving quickly to establish production hubs that will be at the centre of the battery storage value chain, and “governments around the globe are recognizing the imperative of being part of this emerging industry and are investing billions to develop domestic battery, electric vehicle manufacturing capabilities,” the report said. “Jurisdictions that can quickly position their competitive advantages will be best placed to attract an outsized share of these coming investments.”
The federal report cites estimates that by 2040, the international market for energy storage will attract US$622 billion in investment. Global demand for the components that make up lithium-ion batteries will increase from 1.3 million tonnes in 2019 to over 10.1 million tonnes by 2030. “Even the most conservative estimates envision a multitrillion-dollar global market opportunity that Canada cannot afford to ignore,” it states.
Climbing the lithium value ladder
Supplying the raw materials is the lowest value step in the process of producing lithium-ion batteries. As with other commodities, the real value-add lies in the processing of the lithium, cobalt, nickel and other elements to final products — battery packs and the products incorporating them.
Lithium must be purified and refined to produce lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, and then processed with other materials or solvents to produce battery electrodes or electrolytes to produce battery cells. Most refining today is done in China, though countries like Australia and Chile are looking to wrestle some of that dominance away.
How far Canada steps up the value chain ladder could have an enormous impact on the value of any future battery production sector, as each rung provides increasing levels of economic activity and profit. Refined battery minerals command a significant price premium over the unrefined commodity — in June 2019 the spot price for lithium spodumene ore was just US$600 per tonne, compared to almost US$16,000 fetched for refined battery-grade lithium hydroxide, notes the federal report.
According to the Australia-based Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, the market value for mined lithium raw material could be worth $20 billion by 2025. That more than doubles to $43 billion for the value of refined products and skyrockets almost 10 times to $424 billion for finished battery cells.
While China is expected to remain the leading global battery supplier over the next decade, the industry still expects many of the higher quality batteries needed by the automotive industry in North America and Europe to be produced in those jurisdictions as automakers seek vertical integration through the supply chain, presenting an opportunity for Canada to enter the manufacturing stage of the value chain.
“According to industry data, forecasted market demand in North America could exceed planned supply by up to three times. This results in a gap that will need to be met by new players and by existing players increasing their investment commitments to the region,” the report notes.
The prize that goes to those jurisdictions that attract major players emerging in the clean energy field is a large one. Levels of investment and job creation rivals activity in Alberta’s oilsands. Tesla’s US$5 billion gigafactory in Nevada — the carbon-neutral factory will be the largest building in the world by footprint when completed — promised 3,000 construction jobs and 6,500 permanent jobs (a number now surpassed) and a potential US$100 billion boost to the state’s economy over 20 years. Teck Resources Ltd.’s proposed $20.6 billion Frontier oilsands mine was estimated to require 7,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs, while providing $70 billion in government revenue over 40 years.
A strategic resource
National security is also increasingly playing into the conversation in both Europe and North America. Fearing losing access to materials critical to the energy economy of the future, the U.S. in 2018 included lithium in its list of 35 minerals declared “critical to the economic and national security of the United States.”
Canada has followed suit, holding talks with the U.S. administration to discuss ways for the two countries to secure access to minerals including uranium, lithium, cesium and cobalt, and considering defense funding for critical minerals projects and strategic investments in North American processing facilities.
“It is in our interests to ensure that we have reliable supplies of these important minerals for technology, and it’s a conversation that our government is leading on,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a press conference in September. “Canada has many of the rare earth minerals that are so necessary for modern technologies.”
Less well known is that Tesla made a commitment to source material from North America for its North American gigafactories, Tuck said, of which it has two and has recently hinted a third could be built in Texas. In addition to EVs, Tesla produces consumer and grid scale battery packs. “That gives us a huge opportunity to be a secure supply for the North American market for [energy] storage, whether it’s vehicle based or grid-based,” he said.
Underappreciated Canadian expertise
While Canada lags in battery manufacturing, it is an international leader in lithium-ion technology development. Renowned lithium-ion battery expert Jeff Dahn and his 25-person research group at Dalhousie University in Halifax were the team of choice for Tesla’s Elon Musk in his holy grail pursuit to produce a million-mile (1.6 million-kiliometre) battery, more than double today’s capacities. Initially scoffed at, the million-mile concept was the subject of recent research papers published by the Dahn team, which is in the latter stages of a five-year strategic partnership with Tesla.
And last year, Tesla quietly purchased Richmond Hill, Ontario-based Hibar Systems Limited, a leader in precision manufacturing of small cell lithium ion batteries using a highly mechanized pump injection system. The highly regarded manufacturer operates facilities in China — which represents about half its market — and around the world. The world’s leading EV manufacturer, Tesla is close to adding a pickup truck and long haul semi to its lineup and has long hinted at producing its own advanced battery packs for future vehicles.
Green advantage
Canada is also thought to be in a position to produce the world’s greenest lithium, in terms of land and water use, energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of chemical- and energy-intensive processing entailed in hard rock mining could be avoided with petrolithium production, while the level of land disturbance — roughly equivalent to the conventional oil and gas production footprint — would be a fraction of that disrupted by the massive evaporation ponds needed in salar extraction. (The time frame compared to salar extraction would also be shortened to hours or days compared to 18-24 months.)
Low emissions hydropower available in a number of provinces potentially further advantages Canadian producers, according to the federal report. “Canada has one of the lowest GHG emissions per pound of carbonate or hydroxide that would be produced,” Tuck told the Calgary audience, giving Canada a leg up in an industry whose main purpose is to reduce emissions. “There are a number of opportunities here to really push Canada’s brand as the clean and stable supply of these materials.”
Establishing environmental standards for batteries among like-minded battery manufacturing countries would help, said the report. “Canada has an opportunity to promote a green standard that goes beyond GHG emission reductions to look more holistically at the environmental impacts of battery manufacturing (water, air, soil, energy) in order to position Canadian-made batteries as the clean, green choice.”
Of course the mainstreaming of EVs will have other impacts on the economy, particularly for the energy industry. A recently published EY study of the EV transition in Canada found its most aggressive scenario — with EV adoption at 30 per cent by 2030 — could reduce oil consumption by roughly 252,000 bbls a day. Companies need to “view this transition as an opportunity to differentiate before disruption can make their business obsolete,” states the study, Canadian electric vehicle transition — the difference between evolution and revolution.
Facing serious disruption, those companies “that don’t respond quickly cease to be relevant,” while those that do will need to diversify to focus on clean energy and finding new markets. Some large companies have already moved in that direction: Suncor Energy Inc. built out a fast charging network across Canada, while European oil majors are increasingly investing in renewables, EV charging and energy storage.
Playing catch-up 
But for all its strategic advantages, Canada is falling behind in the race to capture a piece of the energy storage value chain pie. Major lithium producing countries like Australia and Chile are already trying to capture more value by marching up the value chain.
Australia has established a Lithium Valley industry cluster co-located with mining projects to leverage its clout as a producer to lure value-add opportunities. A 2018 study for a regional development agency found the country could generate more than $50 billion in annual revenue and support about 100,000 jobs by building a battery materials sector, compared to about $1 billion in annual lithium exports.
And Chile is moving to require companies seeking to increase lithium output to sell a portion at the lowest market price to local refiners as a condition of expansion. Neither country, however, has a vehicle manufacturing industry approaching the size of Canada’s.
 States the report: “The window of opportunity for Canada to realize these opportunities is short as the transformation of the global battery ecosystem is advancing quickly. Given intense competition among governments to capture anticipated private-sector investment, Canada must make a significant commitment to the future of its domestic industry if it is to be part of this important industry.”
Challenges ahead
Among the hurdles to establishing the critical mass needed to develop the sector is the absence of demand from a major EV manufacturer, according to the report. “Attracting international automotive manufacturers in the passenger electric vehicles is likely the most direct option for Canada to enter the automotive value chain. This type of company could then become an anchor firm for other ancillary companies.”
Similarly, the absence of a battery component manufacturer in Canada is limiting investor interest in manufacturing electric vehicles, as batteries represent the most expensive part of the vehicle. Measures to increase business and consumer demand in EVs would stimulate further investment in North American production.
Limited access to risk capital needed to support capital intensive demonstration of unproven technologies is also constraining growth in the petrolithium sector, as is a dearth of government incentives. As a result, “With the exception of a small number of firms, Canada’s energy storage industry is struggling to compete on cost with larger international firms.”
And regulatory uncertainty is holding back the sector (currently there is not even a royalty classification for lithium). Noted Tuck, if permitting processes “aren’t clean and well understood, it certainly limits our opportunity.”
The report also recommends Canada leverage its abundance of renewable power generation and advanced research ecosystem to establish the country as a global leader in stationary energy storage and that it “own specialty markets and battery technologies of the future, including recycling.” Specialty battery manufacturing already exists in the oil and gas industry, which is a leader in niche applications such as for downhole tools.
Concluded Tuck: “We need to work together to make sure that we bring one big critical national effort in this space to make Canada the clean energy material superpower that we know it can be.”

"Kemp: Global Oil Market Is Tight, Despite What Producers Say | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Global petroleum inventories have fallen to their lowest seasonal level for seven years as producers have failed to raise output to match the rapid rebound in consumption since last year’s coronavirus-driven recession.
In contrast to shortages in coal, gas and electricity, the oil shortage is largely discretionary, as producers in the OPEC+ group of major exporting countries and U.S. shale firms have opted to limit increases in their output.
But low inventories have eroded the market’s capacity to absorb faster-than-expected consumption growth or a sudden disruption of output without prices spiking higher.
The consequence has been on display since last month, when Hurricane Ida disrupted offshore output in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a sharp rise in both spot prices and calendar spreads.
Low stocks have created an asymmetric risk profile in which the market is more vulnerable to unexpectedly fast growth in consumption or unanticipated supply outages than the reverse.
Major oil producers say they are not trying to raise prices but are worried about a potential future slowdown in consumption growth as a result of coronavirus flare ups.
But their actions are helping keep inventories below normal and imply they are happy with the rising trend in prices, which is also boosting revenues
Tight market
In the United States, petroleum inventories outside the strategic petroleum reserve are at their lowest seasonal level since 2014, and around 50 million bbls or almost six per cent below the pre-pandemic five-year seasonal average.
In percentage terms, the current deficit to the pre-pandemic five-year average is in the 87th percentile for all months since 1995, which confirms the market is fairly tight in historic terms.
Across the OECD as a whole, commercial inventories of crude and products are around 165 million bbls or six per cent below the pre-pandemic five-year average.
U.S. commercial inventories have dropped almost 225 million barrels from their peak in July 2020, more than reversing the increase of 205 million bbls during the first wave of the pandemic.
OECD commercial inventories have fallen almost 425 million bbls over the same period, also more than reversing their previous rise of 334 million bbls during the first wave.
On the futures side, Brent’s six-month calendar spread is trading in a backwardation of more than $4/bbl, in the 95th percentile for all trading days since 1990.
The steep backwardation is consistent with a market where stocks are already low and traders expect them to continue falling.
The global market is tight, despite statements from major oil producers that continue to focus on the risks of over-production, rising inventories and falling prices, rather than shortfalls and rising prices.
The most logical inference is producers are comfortable with the rising price trend and willing to chance on prices escalating further in the short to medium term.
Producers will likely continue to restrict output as long as they can deflect blame for increasing prices onto fears about coronavirus flare-ups, future slowdowns in demand, and pressure from investors worried about the energy transition.

"Lauerman: Last Oil Producers Standing Series, Part 3 – Russia And The U.S. | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Editor’s note. Part 1 of the series: Lauerman: Last Oil Producers Standing Series, Part 1 – Net Zero And Saudi Arabia; Part 2 of the series: Lauerman: Last Oil Producers Standing Series, Part 2 – Kuwait, Iran, Iraq And The UAE

Among the eight major oil producers with the greatest chance of producing significant volumes in a net zero world, the only ones presently producing disproportionately more than their resource bases are the U.S. and Russia — the largest and third largest producers, respectively. But in coming decades, oil production in these two countries has the potential of falling more than many of the Big-8 for two reasons: the relatively high cost of developing new resource in each; and the potential for political instability negatively impacting efforts to decarbonize their respective oil industries.
In this, the third of the four-part series, the future competitive positions of Russia and the U.S. will be explored based on their energy transition efforts to date, the nature and location of their remaining oil reserves, and potential for political instability.
Transition efforts
Over the past two decades, U.S. government policies to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been sporadic, with Democratic presidents pushing to tackle climate change and Republican presidents dragging their heals at best. Russian climate policies under Vladimir Putin — whether ruling as president or prime minister — have been minimal.
Putin, at least until very recently, has been a climate change denier of the Donald Trump ilk. But the fear of a future European carbon border tax appears to have encouraged Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov to stand up to their boss and encourage him to begin preparing Russia’s economy and oil and gas industry for the inevitable.
On October 6, Bloomberg reported that the Kremlin is considering adopting a net zero by 2060 target prior to the upcoming global climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, with a 79 per cent reduction slated for 2050. Until now, Climate Action Tracker, a research group, has rated Russia’s climate targets as “critically insufficient,” its lowest rating.
On the oil and gas front, neither the Russian government nor companies have announced plans to decarbonize oil production, but recently have been very active in terms of natural gas. In July, Mishustin announced he had created a hydrogen working group with major domestic companies to respond to the global energy transition, while state-owned gas giant Gazprom has since said that Russia plans to be the world’s leading blue hydrogen exporter by 2030.
In terms of the U.S., the administration of Barack Obama was a key architect of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and regulated methane emissions from the country’s oil and gas industry through executive order — due to a recalcitrant Republican-controlled Congress. Joe Biden adopted a net zero by 2050 target for America upon becoming president in January. On the flip side, the George W. Bush administration refused to implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in the first decade of this century and President Donald Trump did his best to sandbag climate change initiatives at home and abroad during his four years in office.
At the same time, the U.S. oil industry continues to resist domestic and international pressure to decarbonize oil and gas production in the country. This led to investor activist campaigns earlier this year to force supermajors Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation to adjust their capital spending plans to prepare for the global energy transition.
In April, Exxon announced a tentative US$100 billion plan to create a consortium to sequester up to 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year under the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. But this plan is to capture carbon emissions from oil refineries and petrochemical plants in the region, rather than oil or gas production. And rather remarkably, not a single blue hydrogen project has been formally announced this year for the U.S. despite being the world’s largest natural gas producer.
Resource issues
As discussed in Part 1 of this series, Russia is a relatively low-cost oil producer with large proved reserves, while the U.S. is a relatively high-cost producer with moderate reserves (see Table 1). But what was not stated at the time is that both of these countries are mature producers, and the cost of developing new resource in the north of Russia is substantially higher than the average cost of present production and the cost is somewhat higher to exploit new tight oil resource in America.
Table 1

This is not to say that Russia, and even more so the U.S., couldn’t slash these costs in coming years and decades. Russia has shown impressive technological prowess over the years, even under the moribund Communist economic system, while American ingenuity continues to bolster productivity gains to bring down the cost of tight oil production. For example, since January 2007, oil production per drilling rig in America’s seven tight rock regions has improved an average of 2.1 per cent month!
However, oil production costs can’t be slashed below zero, which is what would be needed in 2050 if the Russian and U.S. oil industries are to compete if they fail to cut their scope one and two emissions and are forced to pay carbon taxes assumed under the International Energy Agency’s Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario. Decarbonization should be doable in both countries, especially the U.S. with its relatively diversified and prosperous economy, but it would require political will and political stability.
Political instability
And both these countries have the potential for political instability, albeit for very different reasons, and barring the sudden death of Putin likely much sooner in the U.S. than Russia.
U.S.
“The United States is heading into its greatest political and constitutional crisis since the Civil War, with a reasonable chance over the next three to four years of incidents of mass violence, a breakdown of federal authority, and the division of the country into warring red and blue enclaves,” says Robert Kagan, a highly-respected American neoconservative scholar, in an extended Washington Post op-ed published in late September.
In a nutshell, Kagan argues that Trump will be the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2024 — 90 per cent of card carrying members continue to support him — and he will win it by hook or by crook, as “the amateurish ‘stop the steal’ efforts of 2020 have given way to an organized nationwide campaign to ensure that Trump and his supporters will have the control over state and local election officials that they lacked in 2020” to “find” more votes for Trump, if needed.
“The stage is thus being set for chaos,” says Kagan. “Imagine weeks of competing mass protests across multiple states as lawmakers from both parties claim victory and charge the other with unconstitutional efforts to take power. Partisans on both sides are likely to be better armed and more willing to inflict harm than they were in 2020.”
But, of course, this bleak scenario is not a forgone conclusion. Trump could die or otherwise become incapacitated in the interim, according to Kagan, while the few anti-Trump Republicans left in the U.S. Congress could band together with the Democrats to stop Trump and his cronies from rigging America’s electoral system. At the same time, Kagan has been very wrong before. He was one of the intellectual architects of America’s ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Russia
Since Putin was appointed prime minister in August 1999, Russia has become what political scientists call a “personalist autocracy.” Autocratic regimes based on a cult of personality, as established by Putin over the past two decades by reviving his country economically and politically from the ashes of the Soviet Union, tend to be extremely stable, especially for a leader with an approval rating averaging around 75 per cent — and about two-thirds today. But these regimes tend to be highly unstable once the leader dies, or on rare occasion steps down, with power transferring to his or her handpicked successor.
“One of the greatest threats to personalist regimes’ stability is succession,” says Torrey Taussig, research director at the Harvard Kennedy School, in an article published in The National Interest in March 2018. “Systems governed around a cult of the individual set up a self-defeating incentive structure. Once power has been consolidated, the leader will seek to eliminate able and ambitious competitors who could threaten his rule. This strategy, while effective in the short term, hollows out the leadership funnel in the long term. Unlike in autocracies run by strong parties, in which leaders rise within the party’s hierarchy, personalist systems have no institutional structure for preparing the next generation of autocrats.”
We have certainly seen the hollowing out of the leadership funnel in Russia, with former prime minister and president Dmitry Medvedev, Putin’s talented heir apparent, being shunted aside in 2020 for a virtual unknown when his political master had the Russian constitution changed to allow himself to remain president for two more terms — and four consecutive ones, rather than the previous two-term limit. This could keep Putin in office until 2036, at which point he will be 83 years old. A less talented successor is more likely to encounter political instability, and potentially regime change sometime down the road. This is especially the case in Russia as oil and gas revenue dwindles due to the global energy transition.
The fourth and final part of this series will look at where Canada stands relative to our major oil competitors, and what more our companies and governments will need to do to compete for a much smaller market in the more distant future.

"Millington: Embracing ESG, Flaws And All | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Editor’s note: Dinara Millington co-authored the “ESG and the Canadian Energy Sector” report with Marla Orenstein and Brendan Cooke. The report was produced under the auspices of the Canadian Energy and Climate Nexus and Canada West Foundation.

The recent surge of focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters by investors and other affected stakeholders has only been intensified by current public health, economic and societal crises.
Essentially, ESG is meant to be a way by which companies can be assessed/ranked with respect to a wide variety of factors, that measure the non-financial, social impacts of their investments and operations. At the same time, ESG is meant to provide a range of business and investment opportunities.
The excitement around the potential benefits of ESG reporting is increasing. In some circles, so is the criticism of what it can accomplish. The Canadian Energy and Climate Nexus (CECN) in collaboration with Canada West Foundation (CWF) released a report titled ESG and the Canadian Energy Sector that aimed to clear some confusion. The report examined the rise in ESG reporting; growing hype around ESG and the extent to which it holds true or not; current reporting practices of ESG and quality of reporting in the Canadian energy sector; and what companies and governments could be doing in response to an increasing ESG reporting wave. This article highlights a few interesting results.
Overall, we found that there is a strong business case for Canadian energy companies to embrace ESG reporting. ESG may increase access to lower-cost capital, attract and retain highly skilled and talented personnel, improve the company’s performance and governance, lower material risks and impacts, and enhance brand and reputation. However, these benefits are not driven by the simple existence of an ESG report — the companies that have seen gains are the ones that do more than report and publish, and instead integrate sustainability principles companywide.
The primary and secondary data analysis on 150 public and private companies from four energy subsectors, including oil and gas, wind and solar, electric utilities and pipelines in Canada, revealed some interesting trends in the Canadian energy companies’ ESG journey.
Among the four subsectors, ESG reporting has been rising. But the results are mixed. Major electric utilities and largest oil and gas companies provide ESG reports, but that starts to drop off significantly for smaller oil and gas producers (only 20 per cent of the sample size reports on ESG metrics), renewable energy companies (33 per cent), smaller utilities and pipeline companies (39 per cent). The surveyed international oil and gas majors all produce an ESG report, but less than half show any ESG details on their Canadian projects.
The approach to reporting among those that provide public ESG information also varies in terms of the extent of reporting, the issues that are considered material, the metrics that are selected, and external standards or frameworks that are referenced. Individual companies are at extremely different levels of maturity in their ESG reporting, and this is reflected in the quality of what they produce. With recent efforts for consolidation of standards, increasing use of third-party assurance of sustainability reporting, and the company’s own experience, quality is likely to increase in the future.
Among factors that may influence ESG reporting included the company’s size, private or public ownership, the influence of industrial organizations/associations, concerns on reputational risk, and regulatory requirements.
There are key success factors for energy companies operating in Canada when it comes to ESG. First, our interviews revealed that for companies that have successfully integrated ESG reporting, there is, often, a champion at the top of the organization — such as a president/CEO or a board director, who advocates for sustainability reporting and leads company’s efforts.
Secondly, the selection of an ESG framework is important. There is no single right answer. Canadian energy companies have taken different approaches and many use more than one set of frameworks. Within Canada, there appears to be growing support of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework (for climate-related risk disclosure) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) (for everything else) among large institutional investors. A potential consolidation of major standard frameworks into one single reporting system would reduce confusion and cost for both producers and users of sustainability information.
Most energy projects in Canada take place in areas that are either on or adjacent to lands for which Indigenous people are rights holders. This means that the relationship between energy companies and Indigenous peoples and communities is one of the most important to develop, grow and build trust around. A crucial third factor is how to translate this complex relationship into a series of ESG metrics. And the major ESG frameworks are not helpful either. In the First Nations Major Projects Coalition’s paper, the authors state “the vast majority of existing ESG standards do not include the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, and have been developed in the absence of Indigenous input and buy-in.” Canadian energy companies should robustly and transparently describe their engagement and relationships with Indigenous groups, and better yet involve affected groups in determining what factors are important to include.
Governments also have a role in supporting strong ESG performance, through creating policy tools and levers that are on par with the country’s net-zero emissions targets and will provide credibility for companies’ own net-zero targets. Governments could also assist with assembling and publishing objective data that support ESG performance claims. Initiatives, like Net Zero Standard for Oil and Gas, only highlight the role governments can play. In early September, a group of investors managing more than $10 trillion in collaboration with the world’s majors launched a Net Zero Standard for Oil and Gas. This roadmap outlines 10 required standards to help money managers compare companies’ strategies and understand whether they are aligned with United Nations-backed efforts to reduce global carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.
And yet legitimate criticisms remain. While more and more capital is being directed by sustainability performance — $40.5 trillion globally in 2020 alone — a substantial amount of investment is still made using only financial criteria, absent ESG. When asked how frequently do industry portfolio managers and financial analysts in Canada include material ESG issues or adjust their valuations as a result, relatively few Canadian investment portfolio managers evaluate ESG criteria “often or always” in their analysis or to adjust valuation models.
Expectations that ESG can be the driving force for significant positive social and environmental change must be tempered. It is important for the public — including investors, governments, NGOs and others — to recognize the limitations of ESG and address them. There is not enough information yet on whether ESG can create a meaningful difference in climate, environmental or social outcomes, or whether ESG reporting focuses on relatively trivial issues and misses the larger picture. However, as ESG adoption increases and the quality of data improves, it would be worth investigating whether there is significant positive system-level impact on society and the environment.
The ESG field is complex. It can be challenging not only for companies, but also for investors, governments, regulators and other stakeholders to know how to respond. Rapid changes are taking place — some of which may help “connect the dots” and resolve some of the confusion — including efforts to consolidate ESG frameworks, and increasing guidance being provided by regulatory bodies and stock exchanges.
For the Canadian energy sector, there are benefits to embracing ESG, flaws and all. An emphasis on ESG reporting is an opportunity for Canadian energy companies to demonstrate how they intend to build successful businesses in a sustainable world.

"Lauerman: Last Oil Producers Standing Series, Part 2 – Kuwait, Iran, Iraq And The UAE | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
In the first part of this four-part series, the future competitive landscape was outlined for Canada’s oil producers, based on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net-zero emissions (NZE) scenario, our most likely competitors were identified, and the future competitive position of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia was explored.
Here, in Part 2, the future competitive position of the other big Persian Gulf oil producers — UAE, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq —  will be assessed, based on their current steps to prepare for the global energy transition, and likely future ones based on a range of factors, including their socio-economic-political situations.
UAE and Kuwait
The UAE and Kuwait have similar natural advantages as Saudi Arabia, with large proved low-cost and low-carbon oil reserves (see Table 1). But the demographics of the UAE and Kuwait are more favourable, with significantly smaller populations —  especially nationals of each —  and relatively slow rates of growth. On paper this should allow much more funding to decarbonize their oil industries over the coming decades than Saudi Arabia, especially given their relatively high standards of living and larger sovereign wealth funds (SWF) on a per capita basis.
Table 1

This is certainly the case for the UAE, where Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ), the de facto ruler of Abu Dhabi —  the dominant emirate —  holds similar autocratic powers as MBS in Saudi Arabia. In contrast, Kuwait, a quasi-constitutional monarchy, has seen infighting between the government appointed by the Emir and elected parliament in recent years, leading to legislative gridlock and policy paralysis.
UAE
The UAE’s energy transition plans rival those of Saudi Arabia, but the emirates are moving much quicker to achieve their goals than the Kingdom. The UAE is aiming to increase clean energy’s share of its fuel mix to 50 per cent by 2050, while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power generation by 70 per cent. In addition, state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has committed to reduce the carbon intensity of its oil production by 25 per cent by 2030.
To achieve these goals the UAE is quickly mobilizing domestic and foreign companies and capital. For example, the Al Dhafra solar project in Abu Dhabi, to be the world’s largest single-site solar plant at 2 gigawatts (GW) upon completion of all phases, is to begin operations in 2022. The Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) is developing the plant in consortium with Abu Dhabi’s Masdar, France’s EDF Renewables and China’s Jinko Power.
In addition, ADNOC, quasi-SWF Mubadala Investment Company and holding company ADQ have formed an alliance to make the UAE a leader in green and blue hydrogen production for both domestic and foreign markets. ADNOC has also signed agreements with Italy’s ENI and France’s TotalEnergies to develop carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) capabilities to mitigate emissions from its oil and gas facilities.
To help fund these projects the UAE has essentially two SWFs —  Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and the previously mentioned Mubadala – with roughly US$900 billion in assets between them, and a relatively good track record at attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2020, for example, US$20 billion of FDI flowed into the emirates, almost four times more than Saudi Arabia. The UAE’s energy transition efforts are also supported by a relatively diversified economy, with oil and gas output directly accounting for only 30 per cent of its GDP.
On the political front, there are frictions at times between the seven emirates, but Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about 87 per cent of the UAE’s territory —  excluding islands— and the vast majority of its oil wealth, tends to use the power of the purse to smooth them over. Internationally, the emirates are protected from potential Iranian aggression through its close military relationship with the U.S. — including about 5,000 personnel at three formal and informal bases —  as in Kuwait.
Kuwait
Kuwait is a paradox. It’s one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with the fifth highest per capita gross national income and the third largest standalone SWF at around US$700 billion. But since the 2014-16 oil price crash it has lacked the funds needed to move major development and environmental programs forward in a timely fashion.
For example, the second phase of the four-phase, 4 GW Shagaya Renewable Energy Park —  the first phase was a pilot project totaling 70 MW of concentrated and PV solar and wind power —  was recently put back out for tender by the Kuwaiti government after a three-and-a-half year delay.
Delays such as these are because of the National Assembly refusing since 2017 to grant the government permission to withdraw funds from the Futures Generations Fund or issue government bonds, primarily due to widespread concerns about corruption and financial mismanagement by people associated with the ruling Al Sabah family.
At the same time, Kuwait presently lacks a plan to decarbonize its oil industry, while the country’s economic diversification program appears largely mired in the oil sheikhdom’s past, despite crude oil still accounting for around 90 per cent of its export earnings and budget revenue. The cornerstone of Kuwait Vision 2035 is to position the country as a global hub for oil refining and petrochemicals, much of it significantly delayed as well. But coming back to the Shagaya project, the country is targeting renewable energy to account for 15 per cent of its energy mix by 2030, from basically zero today.
Iran and Iraq
Iran and Iraq may have similar natural advantages as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait, but their oil industries have been stunted by a combination of wars, revolution and economic sanctions since the late 1970s. Iran and Iraq are multi-ethnic states, with divisions especially rife in the latter, whereas the Persian Gulf monarchies are mostly Sunni Arabs —  with the exception of their large expat communities, of course. Despite being quasi-democracies, Iran and Iraq have been riddled by political unrest, especially over the past decade or so.
To date, neither Iran nor Iraq have announced plans to decarbonize their oil industries, but for a very different reasons than Kuwait, as they are preoccupied with keeping their economies afloat in an attempt to maintain social stability. Iran has a mere US$24 billion in its SWF and Iraq doesn’t even have one, but lots of government debt.
Iran
Economics, including corruption and economic mismanagement, may be contributing to political unrest in both Iran and Iraq, but the key driver differs in each country. The Iranian people have become increasingly disgruntled with their Islamic-based regime, in power since the 1978-79 Iranian Revolution. Since the rise of the Green Movement in 2009, the regime has had to resort to increasingly draconian forms of social control to quell ever-larger demonstrations among a greater cross-section of the population that have spread to all corners of the country. This past summer the latest round of demonstrations were precipitated by worsening water shortages in Iran due to climate change.
On the surface, this would appear to suggest the days of the Islamic regime are numbered. But with the world presently dividing into authoritarian and democratic blocs and Tehran signing a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” agreement with China in March, it appears the Islamic regime is here to stay —  much like the authoritarian Chavista regime in Venezuela. In this case, and with Venezuela serving as the model, there is no reason to expect economic revival in Iran for the foreseeable future or a serious effort to decarbonize its oil industry to prepare for a net-zero emissions world.
Iraq
The key driver for political unrest in Iraq is the ethnic divide between the dominant Shiite Arabs in the south, the previously dominant Sunni Arabs in the center, and the Kurds in the north. The U.S. inadvertently imposed a “tyranny of the majority” on the Iraqi people when it overthrew the Sunni-dominated Saddam Hussein regime and imposed democracy on the country. Shiite Arabs represent about 60 per cent of the population, compared to around 20 per cent each for the other two major ethnic groups.
The most recent manifestation of this ethnic divide was Islamic State (IS) suddenly taking over central Iraq in mid-2014, as Sunni Arabs in the region —  including those in the armed forces —  tended to support this group over the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. This led to a four-year war to regain IS-held territory in central Iraq.
Since these ethnic divisions aren’t going to disappear, especially since these three ethnic groups were under separate jurisdiction prior to their unification under British mandate in 1920, Iraq could go one of two ways. The status quo seems to suggest continuing corruption and cronyism by the Shiite-dominated central government, economic stagnation, and a lack of resources to decarbonize the country’s oil industry. Alternatively, Iraq could fragment into three parts over the next decade or two, which may or may not lead to good governance for each, stronger economic growth, and the necessary resources to decarbonize their respective oil industries.
In Part 3, the future competitive positions of the U.S. and Russia, presently the world’s first and third largest oil producers, will be explored based on the IEA’s NZE scenario.

ConocoPhillips Defies Texas Governor’s Ban With Vaccine Mandates | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — ConocoPhillips will require U.S. employees with “significant Covid-19 exposure risk” to be vaccinated amid conflicting federal and state decrees.
New employees in the U.S. and workers relocating to the country also will have to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8, ConocoPhillips said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The mandate will apply to less than 10 per cent of the company’s U.S. workforce, and mainly in Alaska. 
A small number of employees in Texas will be covered by the requirement, which was communicated to staff on Oct. 5, before Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order blocking vaccine mandates.
International Business Machines Corp., American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. are among U.S. corporations adhering to the federal mandate despite Abbott’s prohibition against such measures in the second-largest U.S. state. The order earlier this week pits the Republican Abbott against President Joe Biden, a Democrat who recently called for companies with 100 or more workers to require vaccines or weekly testing.
ConocoPhillips said there are “several government directives that require a more thorough review to determine their applicability to our company and our industry.” It will “comply with applicable laws and regulations based on jurisdiction.”
The company’s mandate gives limited accommodation for certain medical or religious reasons.
Oil companies are particularly concerned about low vaccination rates in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the world’s biggest shale field. ConocoPhillips is set to become the Permian’s No. 2 crude producer after it agreed to buy Royal Dutch Shell plc’s assets in the region for $9.5 billion last month.

Oilsands Majors Accrue $7.8 Billion In Free Cash Flow | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canada’s oilsands majors continue to generate huge amounts of free cash flow in 2021.
Higher commodity prices in the first half of 2021, coupled with a slow return to pre-pandemic levels of capital spending, have resulted in operating cash flow significantly outweighing capital budgets for many producers across the U.S. and Canadian upstream sectors this year.
“This is especially true in the Canadian oilsands, with Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, MEG Energy Corp. and Suncor Energy Inc. recording a combined free cash flow of $7.8 billion in the first half of the year,” said Mark Young, senior analyst at Evaluate Energy.
This analysis is part of a new Evaluate Energy report on key cash flow and capital management trends across the North American upstream sector. Access the report here.
“While it is not unusual for oilsands producers to generate billions in free cash flow, these 2021 values remain highly significant,” Young said. “Only three financial quarters between the start of 2018 and the beginning of the pandemic in Q1 2020 saw values higher than the free cash flow recorded in either Q1 or Q2 2021.”
Despite this recent high in free cash flow, the data also shows that capital spending has now recovered to pre-pandemic levels for the five producers.
“These oilsands companies never deviated far from spending $2.5-$3.5 billion each quarter before the pandemic started in Q1 2020, and Q2 2021 was the first quarter of that magnitude since,” Young said. “This can actually be seen across the Canadian industry, with the other 37 Canadian producers in our report recording combined Q2 capex greater than averages seen prior to the pandemic.”
Evaluate Energy’s Q2 2021 cash flow review for North American oil and gas producers can be downloaded here. The report includes analysis of dividend increases, capital budget levels and debt-related spending for 86 U.S. and Canadian oil and gas producers.

"Whitecap Boosts 2021 Spending, Sets 2022 Capital Program At $470–$490 Million | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Whitecap Resources Inc. plans to spend $470–$490 million in 2022 and has accelerated its fourth quarter 2021 capital program in light of strong commodity prices and a desire to secure needed services and supplies, the company announced this morning.
“Our accelerated fourth quarter 2021 capital program and our 2022 capital plans generate exceptional returns, quick capital payouts and significant free funds flow,” Grant Fagerheim, president and CEO, told a conference call this morning.
“The 2022 budget is expected to generate $1.4 billion of funds flow, $900 million of free funds flow and over $740 million of discretionary free funds flow after capital and dividends using $70 WTI oil and $3.75 per GJ gas prices.”
Darin Dunlop, senior vice-president, engineering, said the company continues to fine-tune and improve its operational performance, giving the company increased confidence as it heads into the back-end of 2021 and into 2022.
“We look forward to the execution of the announced capital program over the next 15 months as we continue to be impressed with the improvement, optimizations and efficiencies brought forward and acted upon by our teams,” he said.
“These improvements have been realized on both our legacy and recently acquired assets and the teams continue to advance new ideas and opportunities in our core areas.”
With respect to the $55 million of capital Whitecap has accelerated to the fourth quarter, Dunlop outlined the four main drivers of the move.
“One, level-loading our activity to mitigate service sector constraints from higher industry activity expected in Q1. Two, early access to premium equipment, people and materials would provide clarity to our service providers which, in turn, results in optimal pricing and performance,” he said.
“Three, efficiency gains by designing longer and steadier programs during seasons of optimal efficiency. And four, a more balanced program allows for consistent crews and services, ensuring safe and efficient operations, which is of the utmost importance to us.”
In the revised 2021 guidance, capital spending is now expected to be $425–$435 million which adds 39 (34.7 net) wells to the company’s fourth quarter program. The company also added $11 million in infrastructure preparation to its fourth quarter 2021 program.
Dunlop said that starting the 2022 capital program early and locking in key services will help to ensure the efficient execution of its 2022 capital plans.
“By accelerating our program we are now peaking at 10 rigs in Q4 and Q1 as opposed to 16 without the acceleration; we are also able to maintain a more continuous year-round drilling program which will promote additional cost optimization,” he said.
“Although we expect our program optimization to outweigh inflationary pressure, we have conservatively assumed an average five per cent price increase for services and materials for our 2022 program.”
Whitecap also increased its 2021 average production guidance to 111,000–112,000 boe/d (76 per cent liquids) primarily due to the continued outperformance of the base 2021 program and from the increase in fourth quarter capital.
A closer look at 2022 plans
The 2022 capital budget of $470–$490 million will see the company drill 163 (131.8 net) wells, resulting in average production of 121,000–123,000 boe/d (73 per cent liquids). The budget is $90 million lower than preliminary expectations, with approximately $55 million due to acceleration of capital into late Q4/21 to solidify service sector requirements while optimizing the 2022 capital program, and approximately $35 million from continuation of the capital efficiency improvements achieved during 2021.
With the strategic acquisitions completed in 2021, Whitecap’s natural gas production in 2022 is expected to be approximately 198 mmcf/d, allowing shareholders to also benefit from the currently strong natural gas prices in conjunction with increasing crude oil prices.
In addition to drill, complete, equip and tie-in costs, the company will be spending approximately $85 million on waterflood/enhanced oil recovery (EOR) initiatives, including $28 million for CO2 purchases, along with health, safety and environmental initiatives.
The budget is designed to generate significant free funds flow by advancing growth projects while maintaining Whitecap’s low base decline rate of approximately 20 per cent.
Further budget details and a breakdown by business unit is as follows:

In northern Alberta and B.C., the company expects to spend $165–$170 million to drill 18 (14.8 net) wells, including 10 (6.8 net) Montney wells at Kakwa and Karr. Along with maintaining one rig throughout the year at Kakwa and Karr, Whitecap anticipates spending $15–$20 million to develop water handling infrastructure to further improve operating costs, completion costs and water management in the area. The remaining eight (8.0 net) wells will target the Cardium and Charlie Lake formations.
In eastern Saskatchewan, Whitecap expects to spend $135–$140 million to drill 62 (51.5 net) wells. At Weyburn, the company anticipates drilling 15 (9.8 net) wells, including 10 (6.5 net) wells as part of its next CO2 EOR expansion phase along with five (3.3 net) infill wells. Following up on a very successful 2021 conventional program, the company plans to drill 39 (33.8 net) Frobisher wells, including 26 (22.3 net) multi-leg horizontal wells. The remaining eight (7.9 net) wells are targeting other Mississippian formations along with one (1.0 net) Torquay well.
In western Saskatchewan, the company expects to spend $95–$100 million to drill 60 (49.8 net) wells. The company said its Viking asset continues to mature and along with operational improvements, its base decline has shallowed, and it contributes strong free cash flow. Whitecap anticipates drilling 35 (32.1 net) wells in the Viking in 2022 and 25 (17.7 net) wells in Southwest Saskatchewan, with most drills targeting the Atlas and Lower Shaunavon formations.
In central Alberta, the company expects to spend $75–$80 million to drill 23 (15.6 net) wells. This business unit will use two rigs running through the first and third quarters, with a program focused on further evaluation of the multi-zone potential across its expanded land base. Whitecap plans to drill 12 (10.0 net) Cardium wells, nine (3.6 net) Glauconite wells and two (2.0 net) Ellerslie wells as part of the 2022 program.

Additional information
Fagerheim said Whitecap expects to direct approximately 50 per cent of 2022 discretionary funds flow towards its balance sheet to continue to “build dry powder” for disciplined and targeted acquisitions, as well as New Energy initiatives.
The remaining 50 per cent will be returned to shareholders through dividends and targeted share buybacks.
“The base dividend is an integral part of our return of capital priority and based on the current commodity price environment, we will have the ability to significantly increase the dividend again in 2022,” the CEO said.
The company currently has 26.3 million shares available to acquire on its NCIB, which expires May 20, 2022, and could repurchase approximately 30 million common shares or five per cent of common shares outstanding on an annual basis.
The board of directors has approved an increase to the monthly dividend to $0.0225 per common share from $0.01625 per common share, which equates to an annual dividend of $0.27 per common share. The increase will take effect beginning with the October dividend payable in November.

"Climate Worries Bolster CCUS Plans, Though Action Still Years Away | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Though carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS, or CCS) facility development remains a tiny fraction of overall emissions, projects in the pipeline took a dramatic jump in the first nine months of 2021, according to the Global CCS Institute.
In its status report, published early to precede the COP26 UN climate summit later this month, the Australia-based think-tank reported 71 projects were added to the list, representing “an astonishing doubling of the total number of CCS facilities that are operating or in development since the 2020 Global Status of CCS Report was published.”
Of the 135 commercial CCS facilities in the project pipeline, 27 are fully operating, four are under construction and 102 are under development. The CO2 capture capacity of all facilities under development has grown from 73 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 111 mtpa — about a 50 per cent increase over 2020.
The GCI also found CCS projects are becoming increasingly diverse, with facilities in development in a broad range of sectors including power generation, liquefied natural gas, cement, steel, waste-to-energy, direct air capture and storage, and hydrogen production.

The U.S. leads the rankings with 36 projects announced this year, including several small-scale projects connected to regional networks. Other leading countries are the U.K. with eight, the Netherlands with five and Belgium with four. New countries added to the list with commercial CCS facilities under development include Denmark, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia and Sweden.
“Undoubtedly, the key driver is the introduction of more ambitious climate targets and action. Net-zero commitments made by more than 100 countries and by thousands of companies has driven home the necessity of CCS, and this has kickstarted a virtuous cycle whereby governments around the world are strengthening policy support for CCS,” Guloren Turan, general manager of Advocacy and Communication at the GCI, said in a press conference launching the report.
The growth was attributable to projects in early development, up from 35 mtpa to 60.9 mtpa, and projects in advanced development, which increased from 37.7 mtpa to 46.7 mtpa.
North America leads in both projects operating, at 16, and under development, with 60. Europe has three operating and 35 new under development. Future growth is expected to come from developing countries as they too ramp up climate policy and develop business models.
Capture rates flat
To be sure, volumes actually captured by completed projects remains under 40 mtpa today, a miniscule amount compared to the over 40 billion tonnes emitted annually. And the project pipeline has only returned to where it was in 2011, when similar volumes of capture were on the books.
Forecast capacity decreased year on year between 2011 and 2017, likely due to factors such as the public and private sector focus on short-term recovery after the global financial crisis, the GCI said. Since 2017, the number of planned projects has increased by an average 30 per cent per annum to a total capacity of 149.3 million tonnes if all proposed projects are added to those in operation.
“The International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario foresees 15 per cent of emissions reductions to come from CCS, requiring a one-hundred-fold increase in the capacity of operational facilities by 2050. While the acceleration of CCS adoption is promising, more urgency in the deployment of the technology is needed to reach 2050 climate goals,"" said Turan.
Still, in all the years that the Institute has been recording and publishing the data on CCS, never before has such a big single year increase in the project pipeline been recorded, said Brad Page, former GCI CEO, in a forward to the report. “I am hugely encouraged that CCS is now on a strong growth trajectory after enduring some very difficult years.”
The CCS project pipeline mirrors climate ambition, growing steadily since the 2015 Paris Agreement. Civil society’s calls for government and the private sector to align their policies and practices with climate stabilization have grown in number and volume.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that five-10 gigatonnes of CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere each year in the second half of this century to offset residual emissions that are very difficult to abate — such as those from agriculture and air travel — and to reduce the total load of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to below the carbon budget for 1.5 C of global warming — correcting for the overshoot.
“It is no coincidence that recent growth in net zero commitments has been accompanied by an unprecedented spike in CCS activity,” states the report. “CCS often emerges as an essential part of the lowest cost pathway to net zero.”
There remains “a massive gap” between today’s CCS fleet and what is required to reduce emissions to net zero midcentury. Limiting global warming to 2 C requires installed CCS capacity to increase from around 40 mtpa today to over 5,600 mtpa by 2050.
That means the global CCS industry must grow by more than a factor of 100 by the year 2050 to achieve Paris Agreement targets. “This means building 70 to 100 facilities a year, up to 100,000 construction jobs and ongoing jobs for 30,000 to 40,000 operators and maintainers. The size of the global CCS industry could approach that of the world natural gas industry within a few decades creating a significant engine of growth, alongside renewable energy, in the new low emissions economy.”
Between US$655 billion and US$1.28 trillion in capital investment is needed to 2050. While costly, the GCI notes that investing around one trillion dollars over almost 30 years is well within the capacity of the private sector, which in 2018 invested approximately US$1.85 trillion in just the energy sector.
“In the face of rising expectations from stakeholders and shareholders to invest in assets that aid climate mitigation, the private sector is also actively seeking opportunities. All that’s needed is a business case.”
Building support
By protecting and creating jobs, CCS can build support for strong climate action in places that might otherwise perceive it as a threat, notes the report, pointing to a Canadian example.
“CCS facilities begin as large engineering and construction projects that take years to plan, design, construct and commission. They require a significant development and construction workforce. At its peak, the Boundary Dam CCS facility in Canada employed a construction workforce of 1,700. Similarly, up to 2,000 people helped build the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line. Ongoing jobs are then created to run and maintain the CCS facilities.”
More rapid growth of supporting infrastructure is required by 2030 to bring more projects into the development pipeline and get them operating by 2050. For example, North America’s CO2 transport pipeline network is estimated to need to grow from around 8,000 kilometres today to 43,000 kilometres by 2050.
The rise of CCS hubs
An emerging trend is the development of CCS networks that aggregate CO2 from multiple sources. Networks offer economies of scale for individual CCS sites, by sharing larger infrastructure for CO2 liquefaction and port facilities, CO2 compression and pipelines. (See Net-Zero Targets Ignite Global Interest In CCUS; Hubs And Cross Border Partnerships Flourishing)
Shared infrastructure makes smaller scale CO2 capture projects (200,000 tonnes per annum or smaller) viable. In the U.S. in 2019, approximately 298 mtpa of CO2 was produced by 4,931 individual facilities each emitting under 200,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, representing nearly 16 per cent of industrial facility emissions.
Other parts of the world also have significant volumes of CO2 spread across smaller facilities. “Net zero targets require decarbonization from these facilities and CCS networks can help provide economic, essential infrastructure.”
Key role for blue hydrogen
The report also points to the key role played by blue hydrogen, in which CO2 produced by the conversion of natural gas or coal to H2 is captured and sequestered. Of the 71 new projects announced in 2021, 18 involve production of blue hydrogen. (See Blue Hydrogen Supercharges Expansion In CCUS Application)
One example is Air Products recently announced blue hydrogen project in Edmonton. Based on autothermal reforming hydrogen technology, it will supply the Alberta region with industrial scale clean hydrogen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions there, said the GCI. The project incorporates a hydrogen-fuelled power station, to reduce the emissions intensity of the local power grid. (See Government, Air Products Working To ‘Advance’ Hydrogen Project)
Similarly, U.K. blue hydrogen projects will provide clean hydrogen fuel to help decarbonize other local businesses. They will store CO2 beneath the North Sea, benefiting from economies of scale provided by their host networks. They include Equinor’s Saltend hydrogen project, an anchor for the Net Zero Humber network, BP developing a hydrogen plant as part of the Net Zero Teesside network and Phillips 66 developing a blue hydrogen project at its Humber refinery.
Blue H2 could deliver multi-gigatonnes of abatement annually, when used in various industries, transport and stationary energy, said the GCI. The Hydrogen Council estimates that hydrogen demand could exceed 500 megatonnes by 2050, delivering up to six gigatonnes a year of abatement. That would entail production rising from approximately one mtpa in 2020 to over 500 mtpa by 2050, with production costs low enough to compete with fossil fuels.
Blue hydrogen is very well positioned for rapid scale-up, the GCI said, with lower cost and smaller environmental footprint compared to green hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water.
The world’s largest electrolysis hydrogen production facility, powered by wind or solar energy at Fukushima, Japan, produces only around 2.4 tonnes a day of green hydrogen. By comparison, there are currently seven commercial facilities producing blue hydrogen with total combined production capacity of 1.3 to 1.5 mtpa.
In two extreme scenarios examined by the GCI, producing 530 megatonnes of blue or green hydrogen (the potential 2050 demand estimated by the Hydrogen Council), would cost over US$8 trillion for green hydrogen compared to approximately US$300 billion for blue hydrogen.
“While not definitive, they illustrate that the essential infrastructure required to support production of climate-relevant quantities of green hydrogen could cost 20 or 30 times more than the infrastructure required to support production of the same quantity of clean hydrogen using fossil fuels with CCS.”
Incentives needed
Governments have an important role in supporting CCS investments, said the report. They can provide direct financial support, such as capital grants, to reduce the commercial debt that CCS projects need, and they can mandate specialist financiers — such as development banks, multilateral banks and export credit agencies — to support CCS investments. Specialist financiers can provide low-cost loans and insurance to fund the most high-risk components of CCS projects.
“Of course, the private sector needs confidence in the business case to invest,” said Turan, adding that governments can also help by defining the role of CCS in meeting national emissions reductions targets and communicating this to industry and the public, as well as creating a long-term, high value on the storage of CO2 and support the identification and approval of geological storage resources.
“We are already seeing a lot of these actions being implemented across the world to different extents by different governments and it’s starting to show results. What we need now is more urgency — a lot more urgency,” she said.
“In conclusion, the CCS story in 2021 has exceeded our most optimistic expectations. Against a backdrop of downturn caused by the pandemic, climate continued to rise on the agenda, thankfully, and so did CCS.”

Oil Prices Scale $85/Bbl On Back Of Supply Deficit | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Oil prices jumped to a three-year high above $85/bbl on Friday, on forecasts of a supply deficit over the next few months, spurred by rising demand due to the easing of travel restrictions.
Brent crude futures were up 77 cents, or 0.9 per cent, at $84.77/bbl at 11:48 a.m. EST (1548 GMT). Front-month prices, which touched their highest since October 2018 at $85.10, were headed for a weekly rise of three per cent, which would be their sixth straight weekly gain.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 87 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to US$82.19/bbl. The contract is heading for a 3.5 per cent gain on the week, up for the eighth consecutive week.
Demand has picked up with the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a further boost from power generators who have been turning away from expensive gas and coal to fuel oil and diesel.
The White House said it will lift COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated foreign nationals effective Nov. 8, which should boost jet fuel demand.
Meanwhile, a sharp drop in OECD and U.S. oil stockpiles is expected to keep global supply tight.
“It will take a trifecta of events to derail this oil price rally: OPEC+ unexpectedly boosts output, warm weather hits the northern hemisphere, and if the Biden administration taps the strategic petroleum reserves,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
The International Energy Agency on Thursday said the energy crunch is expected to boost oil demand by 500,000 bbls/d.
That would result in a supply gap of around 700,000 bbls/d through the end of this year, until OPEC+ add more supply, as planned in January.

"NGTL Volume Restrictions Pinch Station 2 Prices, Boost AECO | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Maintenance work on TC Energy Corporation’s NGTL system in recent days has pinched supplies to AECO and flooded Spectra Station 2, resulting in a boost to AECO pricing and weakness at Station 2.
Volumes at Station 2 were fetching 50 cents yesterday (and 70 cents Wednesday). AECO spot prices were at $5.43/GJ on Thursday.
“Yesterday, NGTL, or … TC Energy, announced that starting, I think, yesterday afternoon that there would be some additional restrictions on supplies coming into the upstream transfer portion of the pipe because some of this compression work and other stuff they’re doing up there has ran longer than what they thought and they ran into a couple of unanticipated problems,” said Martin King, senior analyst with RBN Energy, LLC.
“So it may only last a few days. But effectively what that’s done is it’s partially constricted supplies that go downstream towards AECO where AECO is generally priced. So the AECO price has gone up,” he added.
“And because producers that are further upstream of that disruption are trying to get their supplies either onto Alliance or onto Westcoast — they’re all piling onto those pipes — the end result is not enough supply going into AECO and too much supply going into the Station 2 market configurations. So you’ve had a crash at Station 2 but you’ve had an uplift at AECO.”
While that situation has provided a short-term and extra boost to AECO prices, King noted that AECO has been strong in recent weeks as it has been the beneficiary of what’s been occurring in North American and global natural gas markets.
“I think with AECO in the broader sense, it’s been stronger partly just because of an uplift from U.S. gas pricing. The overall market is generally tighter than it was last year and storage in the U.S. is still a little bit below average and you’ve had some decent demand growth this year, as well, through either power generation or industrial demand — just overall demand improvement,” King said.
“And if you really want to kind of stretch things, you could say North America is also feeling some of the heat from international LNG pricing, as well. So it’s a combination of events, and for AECO it’s much more of an uplifting story in 2021 than it certainly was in the previous years.”

Oil Prices Trim Gains After Big Build In U.S. Stocks | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Oil prices rose on Thursday after top oil producer Saudi Arabia dismissed calls for additional OPEC+ supply and the International Energy Agency said surging natural gas prices could boost demand for oil among power generators.
The market trimmed gains after U.S. crude inventories rose more than anticipated as refiners cut production in a generally slower period for those facilities.
Brent crude futures gained 62 cents, or 0.75 per cent, to $83.80/bbl by 12:57 p.m. EDT (1657 GMT) after hitting a session high of $84.50/bbl. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 55 cents to $80.99/bbl.
U.S. crude stocks rose by a surprising six million bbls, much higher than the modest 702,000-bbl increase analysts had expected. Production edged higher, reaching 11.4 million bbls/d.
“The continued rise in domestic U.S. oil production pulls the market back down a bit. It should relieve some of the pressure building in the market,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
Oil demand is set to jump by half a million bbls/d as the power sector and heavy industries switch from more expensive sources of energy, the IEA said, warning that the energy crunch could stoke inflation and slow the world’s economic recovery from the pandemic.
In its monthly report, the IEA increased its global oil demand growth forecast in 2022 by 210,000 bbls/d, and now expects total oil demand in 2022 to reach 99.6 million bbls/d, slightly above pre-pandemic levels.
Saudi Arabia dismissed calls for additional OPEC+ production increases, saying the group’s unwinding of production cuts was protecting the oil market from wild price swings seen in natural gas and coal markets.
At its meeting this month, OPEC+ stuck to its previous agreement to increase output by 400,000 bbls/d a month.
U.S. shale producers have been reluctant to invest in raising output after years of weak returns. U.S. production remains well short of late 2019’s record at nearly 13 million bbls/d. On Wednesday, the EIA said output would rebound to 11.7 million bbls/d in 2022.

"Enbridge Has A ‘Big Head Start’ When It Comes To New Energies, Renewable Infrastructure, ESG Forum Hears | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The Enbridge Inc. executives leading new energy and renewables infrastructure efforts in the energy transition era believe the company has a “big head start with our midstream peers and our position to widen our lead,” the company’s recent ESG Forum webcast heard.
“Our goals going forward are to further differentiate our approach to new energy delivery while making accretive low-risk investments,” said Matthew Akman, senior vice-president, strategy, renewables and new energies.
“Strategically speaking at the highest level, we see our assets as a platform for renewables and new energies. We have a mature and co-ordinated approach to development across our company and our announcement [Sept. 28] to dedicate more resources to new energies only strengthens our execution,” he added.
“We’re excited by the future, and I’m personally looking forward to helping us realize the opportunities ahead.”
Akman said Enbridge is starting from a good spot and are already major players. He noted that the company has over five gigawatts of gross renewable capacity in operation today, consisting of both wind and solar, located across Canada, the U.S. and in Europe.
“We built this up gradually over 20 years with a constant eye on profitability, proving out technology and aligning our investments to our low-risk model. We’re taking that same approach today with new energies. Our early investments are building capabilities and competitive position, while earning revenues that are right down our commercial fairway,” he said.
“We’ll be moving 2.1 PJs [petajoules] of RNG by the end of 2023 — renewable natural gas — and we produce 18,000 kilograms of hydrogen now for injection into our gas utility, but could go 10-times higher if demand is there, which we think it will be.”
Given that, Akman said the company has already eliminated about two million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. And those efforts are expected to only ramp-up going forward.
“As you’re all aware, renewable power is the biggest platform for pure-zero GHG energy at Enbridge today. Many energy companies are just signing contracts with third-party renewable players for a portion of their electricity requirements. But we stand out with our scale, asset base and broad capabilities in developing, constructing and operating renewable power, including onshore wind and solar as well as offshore wind,” he said.
“As our asset base expands every year, so do our capabilities. Our development company, Maple Power Inc. [a joint venture between Enbridge and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board], over in Europe is working closely with our partners to construct offshore wind projects and develop new opportunities.… These are highly complex and large-scale projects requiring unique siting, permitting and construction expertise along with well-developed supply chains which we’ve been carefully building.”
According to Akman, offshore wind is a “more recent foray” for Enbridge but one that’s already achieved scale.
“Offshore wind capacity is forecast to triple globally by 2030 — so explosive growth. Our focus has been on Europe where we see solid fundamentals, good commercial underpinnings and aggressive targets set by government for renewables,” he said.
“We already have ownership interests and several operating facilities in Germany and the U.K., [and] are in the active construction on three more large-scale facilities with 1.4 gigawatts of capacity in France alone. Coming up, right behind that, we’re developing another three gigawatts in Europe with our partner, again, CPPIB.”
Akman said that an “emerging but exciting growth opportunity set” is in floating offshore wind, which he noted has the potential to open up a vast new renewable resource.
“We’re actively working on a pilot in a late-stage in the south of France, and expect to participate in an upcoming utility-scale opportunity on floating wind as well. By mid-decade, our goal is to have enough operating offshore wind capacity to power the equivalent of half a million homes,” he told the virtual audience.
“The renewable business will have a big hand in helping us achieve our emissions reductions goals, too. By self-powering our own pipelines with solar we can substantially cut our Scope 2 emissions, often while reducing our power bills at the same time and generating good returns on capital.”
Akman said that Enbridge already has three operating solar cell power projects and four more under construction, with more likely.
“Right behind that, we see near-term potential of 10 to 15 more facilities with ultimate capacity of several hundred megawatts in the near-term. Those are behind-the-meter plants; in other words, 100 per cent dedicated to our pump and compressor stations,” he said.
“In addition, over and above that, we have the capability and appetite to develop so-called front-of meter renewables that can power our assets, in part, while also providing zero emission energy to third-party customers.”
New energies focus
Malini Giridhar, vice-president, business development and regulatory, said the company’s innovation efforts in new energies “reduce the energy intensity of the energy we deliver” and offset third-party emissions.
“They also leverage the vast geographic footprint of our assets and support their continued use for decades to come. Our 24,000-kilometres of transmission pipeline in the U.S. and Canada, and 85,000 kilometres of distribution pipeline in Ontario, can get RNG and low-carbon hydrogen to the market,” she said.
“And [the company is] uniquely positioned for green and blue hydrogen and carbon capture, which can leverage our renewable power assets, storage and transmission capabilities.”
Giridhar said Enbridge’s asset footprint also “comes with enduring supplier and customer relationships” in North America’s major producing and consuming regions. And those partnerships are vital.
“Aggregating our customers ESG goals with our own goals can provide significant scale. And add to this our demonstrated project execution skills, our strategic technology partnerships and stakeholder relationships and we believe we have all the necessary elements to be successful,” she said.
“Now we see investment opportunities across the value chain for both RNG and hydrogen within the Enbridge value framework, and many of these opportunities will come organically from the need to inject into our pipeline system from which we can then extend both upstream and downstream.”
In terms of RNG, Giridhar said the natural extension for the company is related to upgrading facilities, “because we are the custodians of gas quality on our pipelines.”
But, she added, Enbridge can move “further upstream into biogas production or landfill gas capture” and assess potential opportunities for fit with the company’s low-risk commercial model.
“Now, the technology is proven but adoption will take time as costs remain high,” Giridhar said.
“And in terms of opportunity set, we project that RNG from waste can be three per cent or more of Canada-U.S. demand, or one tcf by 2040 off a base of 80 bcf today. RNG can have emissions reduction potential beyond pure fuel substitution, particularly when it reduces fugitive emissions from landfills and agricultural sites,” she added.
“At a high level we expect that the three per cent blend of RNG in supply can result in a nine per cent reduction in fugitive emissions. Likewise, on hydrogen, too, we can move upstream beyond injection and blending facilities.”
On green hydrogen, Giridhar said Enbridge can move upstream to building electrolysis assets and even co-locate these with the company’s renewable assets. “And on blue hydrogen we have the transportation and storage capabilities.”
She said the company believes hydrogen could make up seven per cent or more of natural gas demand by 2040, but it can also address a number of energy challenges at the same time.
“Namely, it’s a backup to intermittent renewable generation providing reliability [and] it’s a solution to peak winter demand currently served by gas infrastructure and decarbonizing heavy industry,” Giridhar said.
“The takeaway here is that our diversified asset base across conventional and renewable assets, with last-mile connections to customers, will be absolutely key to enable low-carbon fuels. Now there are still some technical challenges to overcome and the costs need to come down further. But we are very excited about the opportunity.”
When it comes to hydrogen and RNG, Giridhar said that since the company’s first foray into RNG in 2011 it has brought three projects into service and it is executing four projects for in-service in 2022 and 2023.
“We have over 50 non-binding expressions of interest within our utility franchise which indicates significant developer interest and 10 to 15 projects in development currently,” she said.

She noted that Enbridge is developing partnerships that will generate even more investment opportunities.
“One example is our partnership with Walker Industries and Comcor [Environmental], which brings together their relationships and technical expertise in building and operating landfill sites with our expertise in gas processing, injection and delivery systems and in the marketing of natural gas,” Giridhar said.
“The partnership will initially prioritize the 40 existing landfill relationships that our partners are bringing.”
Giridhar added that the company’s recently announced partnership with Vanguard Renewables will also see opportunities surface across Enbridge’s gas transmission asset base.
“We have eight projects initially generating up to two bcf per year of RNG. But many other potential sites identified will be developed over the next five years. And this creates a nice opportunity set for growth through this partnership,” she said.
“And our foray into green hydrogen production and blending is a good example of how we identify and incubate an idea, pilot and then deploy.”
CCUS goals
Giridhar said “there’s no doubt” that carbon capture and storage will be imperative as North America, indeed the world, strives to achieve its collective GHG emissions reductions targets.
“Energizing the world with zero-carbon fuels and renewables cannot logistically happen fast enough to hit the two degree scenario or better. Large-scale CCUS will be critical to meeting our goals. And the good news for us is that it will become a big infrastructure investment opportunity,” she said.
“Forecasts suggest that CCUS could grow from a $1 billion industry today to over $1 trillion by 2050. But what will really drive that investment is a price on carbon and whether that’s established by governments and/or the private sector. Carbon markets will become more transparent and liquid over time, which will underpin the economics of these capital investments.”
Giridhar said Enbridge has the expertise in transport, as well as storage of energy products, and “we’ve also been a trusted infrastructure service provider to large emitters for decades.”
She said the company will use these advantages and build on them to develop a “large presence” in CCUS over time.
“And we’ll add new elements to our capabilities including best-in-class technology to compete and win. Our partnership with Svante [Inc.], which has a major capital cost advantage in carbon capture in the emerging market as well as several large-scale infrastructure development opportunities, is a good example of how we’ll approach CCUS development,” Giridhar said.
The bottom line? While the energy transition “will take time and won’t happen overnight,” Giridhar reiterated that Enbridge believes it is “ahead of the curve and will continue to capitalize on our scale to seek exciting growth opportunities in this space.”

Line 5 Opponents Urging White House To Reject Canada’s ‘Audacious’ Treaty Gambit | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(The Canadian Press) — Environmental activists in the United States are seizing on Canada’s decision to invoke a 44-year-old treaty with the United States as an “audacious,” misguided and misleading gambit aimed at short-circuiting Michigan’s effort to shut down the Line 5 cross-border pipeline.
Oil & Water Don't Mix, a coalition of Michigan environmental and Indigenous groups that includes the Sierra Club and the Michigan Climate Action Network, said Tuesday it has a 33,000-signature petition that it plans to circulate among U.S. lawmakers this week.
The petition urges U.S. President Joe Biden to support the state of Michigan and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in their legal effort to shut down Line 5, a 68-year-old pipeline that crosses beneath the Great Lakes to deliver crude oil and natural gas liquids from Canada to the U.S. Midwest.
The state has revoked the 1953 easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate Line 5, citing the risk of a catastrophic spill in the Straits of Mackinac, an ecologically sensitive waterway that links Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.
The resulting dispute has lawyers for both sides arguing in court about whether a district court in Michigan has the jurisdiction to decide the fate of the pipeline and Enbridge’s efforts to upgrade and fortify the twin lines that run along the lakebed under the straits.
Last week, the Canadian government filed court documents confirming that it wants formal negotiations with the U.S. under the terms of a 1977 treaty specifically drafted to deal with cross-border pipelines, and asking Judge Janet Neff to hold the case in abeyance.
Sean McBrearty, the co-ordinator for Oil & Water Don't Mix, called the treaty tactic a “direct attack on our sovereignty” that intentionally misinterprets the treaty itself “to make the audacious claim that we must leave a major risk pumping oil indefinitely through the heart of the Great Lakes.”
He pointed to the oil spill last week off the coast of California, which was likely the result of an underwater anchor strike — precisely the sort of peril that Whitmer and her supporters fear could befall the Great Lakes shoreline if Line 5 continues to operate.
“This fight is not really about Enbridge’s fuel,” he said. “This fight is about Michigan’s water.”
Michigan’s attorney general showed contempt for Canada’s move, disputing the notion that treaty talks are relevant to the legal matters at hand and that the hearings should be paused to allow those talks to proceed.
“Canada is wrong on both counts,” Dana Nessel wrote in a response filed in court last week.
“Neither the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty itself nor Canada’s recent invocation of the dispute resolution process ... are relevant to the sole legal issue now before this court: whether it has jurisdiction over the state’s complaint removed by Enbridge.”
Canada’s letter, she continues, “is devoid of any legal authority or persuasive argument for its assertion that this court should decline to rule” on the matter.
“Staying this case based on some speculative outcome of international treaty negotiations would deprive the state of its ability to protect these core sovereign interests while indefinitely enshrining the status quo that Enbridge desires.”
Proponents of Line 5 say its 540,000 bbls of crude oil and natural gas liquids per day are a vital energy source for markets across the Midwest, including Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Canadian refineries that provide jet fuel to some of Canada’s busiest airports.
Enbridge has insisted from the outset that it has no plans to voluntarily shut down the pipeline.
A court-sanctioned voluntary mediation process, which began in April, has failed to yield any agreement and appears to have fallen apart, although the official status of those talks remains unclear.
Court documents show the state has no “desire to continue with the mediation process,” while Enbridge has said publicly that it wants the talks to continue.

Trafigura To Invest In Large-Scale Ammonia Production | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Trafigura is planning to invest in large-scale production facilities of low-carbon ammonia, a gas which can be used as an energy source to power ships and cut emissions, the commodity trader’s chief executive Jeremy Weir told Reuters.
Shipping currently accounts for around three per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), but that percentage is expected to climb unless the industry goes greener.
U.N. shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is aiming to reduce GHG emissions from ships by 50 per cent from 2008 levels by 2050, but industry groups are calling for accelerated action.
Marine GHG emissions at Trafigura come primarily from the ships used to transport commodities. Trafigura reported 8.88 million tonnes of CO2 emissions from shipping in the year to Sept. 30, 2020, 58 per cent of the total.
Weir declined to give any detail on Trafigura's plans to produce green and blue ammonia, but said it “will help decarbonize the shipping industry.”
Green ammonia is made by combining hydrogen made from water electrolysis and nitrogen using heat from renewable energy, while blue ammonia is made from nitrogen and natural gas, with the carbon dioxide byproduct captured and stored.
The shipping industry is also looking at hydrogen as a fuel source to cut emissions.
However, hydrogen requires twice the tank space for the same amount of energy as ammonia. Hydrogen is difficult and expensive to transport as it needs to be cooled to -250 C, while ammonia requires -33 C.
But ammonia works out more expensive than the very low sulphur fuel oil used for ships as more — about 2.3 times more by volume — is needed.
Trafigura has also invested in ammonia-fuelled engines for maritime vessels being developed by Germany’s MAN Energy Solutions, which if successful could be a game-changer for the shipping industry, Weir said.
MAN Energy’s ammonia engines are expected to be available commercially for large ocean-going ships by 2024. It expects to be able to replace existing internal combustion engines in ships with ammonia engines the following year.
The challenge for Trafigura switching to ammonia fuelled vessels is cost.
“Our gross margins for moving commodities from A to B are around three per cent. We can’t use ammonia if others aren’t; it doesn’t work from the competition aspect,” Weir said in an interview for LME Week, a gathering of the metals industry in London.

CN Rail’s Kansas City Southern Deal Imperiled By U.S. Rebuff | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Canadian National Railway Co. was dealt a potentially fatal blow in its $30 billion effort to acquire Kansas City Southern as U.S. regulators rejected a plan to use a voting trust to make the purchase.
“Applicants have failed to establish that their use of a voting trust would have public benefits,” the U.S. Surface Transportation Board ruled Tuesday. Using a voting trust “would give rise to potential public interest harms relating to both competition and divestiture.”
Kansas City Southern had demanded the trust — a means to pay shareholders even before the deal gets a final antitrust nod — for any merger deal. The STB ruling could prod Kansas City Southern to rethink Canadian National’s offer and send the U.S carrier back into the arms of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.
The takeover battle will determine which Canadian company will become the first railroad to have tracks through Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Kansas City Southern gets about half its revenue from Mexico, which is poised for an investment surge as companies seek to shorten supply lines that stretch to Asia.
The STB has already approved Canadian Pacific’s voting trust, which could give it the upper hand as it courts Kansas City Southern. The STB ruling against Canadian National vindicates Canadian Pacific CEO Keith Creel’s decision not to match his rival’s bid in that hope that regulators would reject Canadian National’s trust.
Creel, who said Canadian Pacific didn’t have the financial firepower to win a bidding war, was emboldened after the STB said Canadian National would have to prove that its deal would be in the public interest, a heavy burden adopted in 2001 to quash industry consolidation.
Canadian Pacific had reached a $25-billion deal for Kansas City Southern only to have it snatched away by Canadian National in May. A last ditch $27-billion bid by Canadian Pacific in August was rejected. The U.S. railroad will now have to decide how the STB ruling changes the equation.
Canadian Pacific, the second smallest of the seven major North American railroads, after Kansas City Southern, only has to establish that its tie-up wouldn’t hurt competition — a lesser standard than faced by the larger Canadian National. Noting Canadian Pacific’s lack of overlapping routes with Kansas City Southern, the STB said in April that the Canadian railroad’s proposal “appears to be end-to-end in nature, which likely raises fewer competitive concerns than a transaction that is not end-to-end.”
Canadian National had sought to blunt some of that concern by committing to sell a 70-mile stretch of track that overlapped with Kansas City Southern’s network in Louisiana.
The ruling is a defeat for Canadian National CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest in his effort to leave his smaller national competitor even further behind. The two railroads have waged a century-old rivalry that has included litigation over poaching employees and clients. Ruest and Creel worked together at Canadian National when Creel was its chief operating officer.
Canadian Pacific has been hoping that purchasing Kansas City Southern would narrow a size gap with Canadian National and match its T-shaped network, which spans Canada and drops down through the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico. Without the acquisition, Canadian Pacific would be isolated in Canada.
Under the terms of its merger agreement with Canadian National, Kansas City Southern can walk away if the regulator rejects the voting trust. In that circumstance, Canadian National would have to pay Kansas City Southern a $1 billion breakup fee. Canadian National may decide to appeal the STB ruling.
A Kansas City Southern merger with Canadian National would create the third largest railroad in North America, leapfrogging Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp., according to a Bloomberg data analysis of five-year sales trends.

UN Adopts Ban On Heavy Fuel Oil Use By Ships In Arctic | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The United Nations shipping agency on Thursday adopted a ban on the use of heavy fuel oil in the Arctic region while green groups said the regulations contained loopholes which will allow many vessels to keep sailing without enough regulatory control.
Antarctic waters are protected by stringent regulations, including a ban on heavy oil fuel (HFO) adopted in 2011, even though no cargo moves through the southern waters. For the Arctic, the rules have been looser.
In a virtual session of its Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved a ban on the use of HFO and its carriage for use by ships in Arctic waters after July 1, 2024.
A series of exemptions and waivers would mean a complete HFO ban would only come into effect in mid-2029, which campaigners the Clean Arctic Alliance said would amount to “endorsing continued Arctic pollution.”
The Arctic is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the planet.
Environmentalists say HFO produces higher emissions of harmful pollutants, including sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon. In addition, a possible oil spill involving HFO from a ship could have a devastating impact on the Arctic’s ecosystem.
The MEPC — which was held June 10-17 — ran out of time and deferred work on black carbon emissions in the Arctic to the next scheduled session in November.

U.S. Says All Options ‘On The Table’ To Tackle Energy Crunch | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on Thursday said all ""tools are always on the table"" to tackle tight energy supply conditions in the market.
The department made the comment amid questions about whether the Biden administration is considering tapping into its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil.
Oil prices have climbed due to a recovery in global energy demand since the depths of the coronavirus pandemic, and production restrictions by the OPEC producer group.
""DOE is actively monitoring global energy market supply and will work with our agency partners to determine if and when actions are needed,"" a spokesperson said.
The Financial Times on Wednesday quoted U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm as saying that the administration is considering tapping the SPR, while also not ruling out a ban on crude oil exports.
Oil prices turned positive on Thursday, however, after a Bloomberg reporter said in a Twitter post that the DOE is not considering tapping into its emergency reserves ""at this time,"" nor pursuing a ban on oil exports.  
A DOE source said the tweet ""is not accurate.""
The United States has used its strategic reserves on occasion, usually after hurricanes or other supply disruptions.
Since ending a 40-year ban on crude exports in 2015, the nation has become a significant exporter, and has not broached cutting exports.

Canadian Oil Exports To The U.S. Jump With New Pipeline Start-Up | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Canadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to the highest volume since the start of the year thanks in part to the start-up of a long-delayed Canadian pipeline.
Last week, Enbridge Inc. started its new Line 3 crude pipeline after years of delays.  
Weekly oil deliveries from America’s northern neighbour reached 4.04 million bbls/d, the most since January, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). It’s only the third time the U.S. has imported more than four million bbls/d of Canadian crude since the agency began compiling weekly data in 2010.
It’s likely these increased flows will be the new norm mainly because of the expanded Line 3, said Elisabeth Murphy, ESAI Energy LLC upstream analyst for North America. In fact, weekly volumes should start to average closer to 3.7-3.8 million bbls/d from here, from current levels of around 3.5 million, she added.
The additional bbls from Canada come as a relief to U.S. refiners struggling with less supply from OPEC+, shrinking imports from Latin America, and more recently, the loss of about 30 million bbls of Gulf of Mexico production after Hurricane Ida.  
Gulf Coast refineries have increasingly been pulling from Canada to offset the crude production in the Gulf of Mexico that remains shut since Hurricane Ida swept through over a month ago, said Shirin Lakhani, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group.

Record Gas Prices Slow LNG Investment In Asia; N. America Scrambles On Exports | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Some of the world's biggest importers of LNG are reducing orders in the face of a 500 per cent price surge within a year, raising concerns among major producers about potential long-term destruction of demand.
LNG buyers, including numerous emerging economies in Asia, are balking at prices that have doubled just within the past month, while a growing number of exporters in North America are straining to boost export capacity that will still take years to come online.
Natural gas is viewed as a more acceptable fossil fuel as growing economies like India, China and Pakistan try to reduce carbon emissions, because it burns more cleanly than oil and coal. But the surge in natural gas prices is prompting power providers to revert to coal and fuel oil and causing a rethink on new LNG investments in Southeast Asia, which was expected to be the heart of LNG demand growth.
Within Asia, which accounts for 70 per cent of global LNG imports, a majority of long-term contracts are oil-linked. But South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh — which together account for 20 per cent of Asia's imports — have a much higher exposure to spot LNG prices, which are currently at a record high of over $50/mmBtu.
That's raised alarm among developers in Southeast Asia, as analysts say plans for new LNG regasification terminals may now be delayed given the high LNG prices and after government budgets were stretched by costly COVID-19 outbreaks, a source familiar with contract negotiations said.
""New buyers are under a lot of pressure to justify signing contracts at these prices, so they have been slow to progress discussions,"" said the source, who has noted a sharp fall in enthusiasm among potential buyers to even discuss LNG projects compared to a year ago. He declined to provide more details or be named due to the sensitive nature of the deals.
For big U.S. export terminal operators, rising prices were initially welcome. However, the volatility in costs makes it harder to sign additional long-term contracts and is a source of frustration, as they know that they will only be able to add incremental export capacity in the next year.
""We didn't like the low and flat prices everywhere in the world of around $2 per mmBtu from a year ago, and I'm not sure what I dislike more with the very elevated prices we find ourselves in now,"" said Anatol Feygin, chief commercial officer at Cheniere Energy Inc., the largest LNG exporter in the United States. ""It is a manifestation of the markets not being very good at investing through the cycle.""
Feygin however said Cheniere would soon decide on an additional expansion at its Corpus Christi LNG export plant in Texas, noting that global prices, when compared with lower U.S. prices, are a tailwind for the company.
U.S. benchmark gas prices are currently at seven-year highs, but at $6/mmBtu, are far from Asian and European levels. The United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcf/d of gas into LNG.
Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States, when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.
After that, the world may have to wait even longer for additional U.S. or Canadian projects. Houston-based Tellurian Inc.,which announced three long-term deals over the summer to sell LNG to units of Royal Dutch Shell plc, Vitol SA and Gunvor Group, is expected to start producing LNG in late 2025 at the earliest, said Charif Souki, executive chairman.
In British Columbia, LNG Canada is not expected to go into service until around 2025. In addition, numerous proposed projects were scuttled between 2019 and 2020 due to persistently low prices.
Lack of investment
Asia's newer buyers of LNG are more affected by price volatility than established importers, who are able to blunt the impact of higher spot prices by pooling those purchases with existing lower cost oil-linked deliveries, said Wood Mackenzie Ltd. vice-president Valery Chow.
""Rising LNG import bills are putting a severe strain on national budgets and [Bangladesh and Pakistan] are actively looking to switch away from gas in favour of lower cost alternatives, like fuel oil, for power generation,"" Chow said.
Bangladesh has cut back on LNG imports, with September's total dropping by 33 per cent from the month before, Refinitiv Eikon shiptracking data showed. The country is also considering extending the leases of five oil-fired power plants and potentially increasing fuel oil imports.
Pakistan has been cancelling and re-issuing LNG tenders the past two months, and may consider relying on just term imports going forward, an industry source said.
There are signs of demand erosion in established buyers India and China. LNG imports into India are down 4.2 per cent through September compared to the same period in 2020. In China, second-tier gas importers — mostly city-gas firms —are scaling back spot purchases.
In South Korea, Asia's third largest importer, one buyer described the situation as ""chaos.”
""The current market situation is not healthy to be in,"" said Qatar's Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi on the sidelines of a virtual LNG conference in Japan. The country is the world's largest LNG supplier, and has said it will boost output by about 40 per cent to 110 million tonnes per annum by 2026.
If LNG prices extend their recent run up, cost-conscious buyers may have no choice but to pare back demand.
""With winter... and no sign of any softening in LNG prices, demand side management and ultimately power rationing may be a last resort,"" said Chow at Wood Mackenzie.

"OPEC+ Sticks To Plan For Gradual Oil Output Hike, Price Roars Higher | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — OPEC+ said on Monday it would stick to an existing pact for a gradual increase in oil output, sending crude prices to three-year highs and adding to inflationary pressures that consuming nations fear will derail an economic recovery from the pandemic.
OPEC+ has have faced calls for additional supplies from big consumers, such as the United States and India, after oil surged more than 50 per cent this year.
OPEC+ ""reconfirmed the production adjustment plan"" that it previously agreed that would see 400,000 bbls/d added in November, the group said in a statement issued after online ministerial talks.
Brent crude roared above $81 on news that the group would stay with its plan for gradual additional production.
""We will be monitoring the situation, as we know, demand usually falls in the fourth quarter, our plans on increasing [output] are even, we will be watching how the market will be balanced,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said.
An OPEC+ source had told Reuters before Monday's ministerial talks that the group had faced pressure to ramp up production faster, but added: ""We are scared of the fourth wave of corona, no one wants to make any big moves.""
The group had agreed in July to boost output by 400,000 bbls/d a month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bbls/d of existing production cuts, already much reduced from curbs that were in place during the worst of the pandemic.
Demand has bounced back swiftly, while supply has been disrupted by factors ranging from hurricanes that have hammered U.S. production to low levels of investment across the industry during the depths of the pandemic when demand cratered.
A senior aide to U.S. President Joe Biden met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia on a range of issues last week, saying oil was ""of concern."" India, another big oil consumer, has pushed for more supply.
""For now, most producing members may be comfortable with an $80 per barrel Brent price, but there is a risk of receiving a backlash or pressure from buyers like the U.S. and China, who are openly calling for lower energy prices,"" consultancy Rystad Energy wrote before the ministers met.
Analysts had said they expected uncertainty about the impact on demand from variants of the coronavirus, which threaten fresh economic disruption, to weigh on OPEC+ decision-making.

"Global LNG: Asia LNG Price Rise On Firm Chinese Demand, Eyes On Russian Flow | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Asia liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices continued to rise this week on the back of higher European gas prices, which fuelled competition from buyers in Asia, while demand is firm from top buyer China.
The average LNG price for November delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at about $38.50/mmBtu, up $1.50 from the previous week, industry sources said.
December delivery prices were estimated to be about $38.40/mmBtu, they added.
Last week, price agency S&P Global Platts’ Japan-Korea-Marker (JKM), which is widely used as a benchmark in the spot market in the region, had surged to a record high of $56.326/mmBtu, before easing later.
“The market is looking to the extent of uncontracted demand in China for winter following the national holiday. This is expected to emerge, but by how much and when will probably be crucial for shaping market sentiment,"" an industry source said.
Facing an ongoing power crunch, amid a shortage of coal for electricity generation, China has been one of the heavy buyers of LNG. The country’s September imports of natural gas, both from pipelines and as LNG, were at a nine-month high at 10.62 million tonnes, 22.6 per cent above year-ago levels.
The heavy Chinese buying is reinforcing the link between Asian LNG pricing and the European TTF benchmark, said Robert Songer, LNG analyst at commodities intelligence firm ICIS, adding that events in Europe will continue to influence Asian LNG prices.
“Attention will continue to be focused on [gas transit] capacity auctions on Monday, and what they reveal about Russia’s bookings for November capacity into Europe, as this is the last chance to stock up on natural gas,” he said.
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday that Russia could resume spot gas sales after it finishes filling its storage reserves.
Novak did not say how soon or in what quantities such sales could take place, but the government has said it intends to keep topping up domestic inventories until Nov. 1.
Freight rates to ship LNG remained high, with LNG freight from the U.S. to Northwest Europe and Northwest Asia approximately at peak levels of $2.50 and $4.50, respectively, per mmBtu, according to data intelligence firm Spark.
Pakistan LNG did not receive any offers in a tender seeking eight LNG cargoes for delivery over December to January.
Turkish state energy company Botas is seeking 19 LNG cargoes for delivery over November this year to March next year.
KOGAS International, the Singapore-based arm of Korea Gas Corp., is offering an LNG cargo for loading from the Australian Prelude plant, for delivery into the Northeast Asia region over Dec. 19-22.

Factbox: North American LNG Export Projects | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — North America currently exports about 10 bcf/d of natural gas as LNG, largely to destinations in Asia like China and India. All of that LNG currently comes from export plants in the United States.
Prices in Asia and Europe have surged due to shortages of fuel needed by power generators to keep electricity flowing, but the United States cannot export any more than it already is doing because it takes years for liquefaction trains to be developed and built.
Right now, there are trains at five projects currently under construction in the United States, Canada and Mexico that would add another 7.0 bcf/d in the next five years.
In addition, there are more than a dozen projects that are being considered for a final investment decision (FID) over the next two years. The following table lists proposed North American LNG export plants with capacities in million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG and bcf/d of natural gas:

China Looks To Lock In U.S. LNG As Energy Crunch Raises Concerns – Sources | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Major Chinese energy companies are in advanced talks with U.S. exporters to secure long-term LNG supplies, as soaring gas prices and domestic power shortages heighten concerns about the country’s fuel security, several sources said.
At least five Chinese firms, including state major Sinopec Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) and local government-backed energy distributors like Zhejiang Energy, are in discussions with U.S. exporters, mainly Cheniere Energy and Venture Global, the sources told Reuters.
The discussions could lead to deals worth tens of billions of dollars that would mark a surge in China’s LNG imports from the United States in coming years. At the height of a Sino-U.S. trade war in 2019, gas trade briefly came to a standstill. LNG export facilities can take years to build, and there are several projects in North America in the works that are not expected to start exporting until the middle of the decade.
Talks with U.S. suppliers began early this year but speeded up in recent months amid one of the biggest power-generating, heating fuel crunch in decades. Natural gas prices in Asia have jumped more than fivefold this year, sparking fears of power shortages in the winter.
“Companies faced a supply gap [for winter] and surging prices. Talks really picked up since August when spot prices touched $15/mmBtu,” said a Beijing-based senior industry source briefed on the talks.
Another Beijing-based source said: “After experiencing the recent massive market volatility, some buyers were regretting that they didn't sign enough long-term supplies.”
Sources expected fresh deals to be announced over the coming few months, after privately controlled ENN Natural Gas Co., headed by the ex-LNG chief of China’s largest buyer, CNOOC, announced a 13-year deal with Cheniere on Monday.
It was the first major U.S.-China LNG deal since 2018.
The new purchases will also cement China’s position as the world’s top LNG buyer, taking over from Japan this year.
“As state-owned enterprises, companies are all under pressure to keep security of supply and the recent price trend has deeply changed the image of long-term supplies in the mind of leadership,” said the first Beijing-based trader.
“People may have taken the spot [market] as the key in the past, but are now realizing that long-term cargoes are the backbone.”
Cheaper U.S. gas
The sources declined to be named as the negotiations are private.
Sinopec declined comment. CNOOC and Zhejiang Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Venture Global declined comment. Cheniere did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We expect more deals to be signed before year-end. It’s primarily driven by the global energy crunch and prices we’re seeing now.... U.S. supplies now stand out as attractive,” said a third Beijing source briefed on the talks.
U.S. cargoes used to be expensive versus oil-linked supplies from Qatar and Australia for example, but are cheaper now.
A deal at $2.50 + 115 per cent of Henry Hub futures, similar to ENN’s deal according to traders, would be roughly about $9-$10/mmBtu on a delivered basis into Northeast Asia. This includes an average shipping cost of $2/mmBtu for the U.S.-China route.
Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence with consultancy Poten & Partners, said Chinese companies are heavily exposed to Brent-related pricing for LNG and the U.S. purchases give some diversity to the pricing.
Asian spot gas prices are currently trading at above $37/mmBtu after reaching a record high of over $56 earlier this month.
Traders expect prices to go higher in winter when demand typically surges.
Chinese buyers are scouting for both near-term shipments to cover demand this winter and long-term imports as demand for gas, seen by Beijing a key bridge fuel before reaching its 2060 carbon-neutral goal, is set for steady growth through 2035.
It’s hard to estimate a total volume of the deals being discussed, sources said, but Sinopec alone could be eyeing 4 million tonnes annually as the company is most exposed to the spot market versus domestic rivals PetroChina and CNOOC, said a third source.
Traders said Sinopec is in final talks with three to four companies to buy one million tonnes a year for 10 years, starting from 2023, and is looking for U.S. volumes as part of the requirement.
Delays in LNG export projects in Canada, in which PetroChina owns a stake, and Mozambique, where both PetroChina and CNOOC have invested, also made U.S. supplies attractive, sources added.
North American LNG exporters have been adding to capacity because of demand in major Asian economies.
Cheniere, the largest exporter out of the United States, said in late September it expects to announce “a number of other transactions” that will support its going forward with the Corpus Stage 3 expansion next year.
Venture Global is building or developing over 50 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG production capacity in Louisiana, including the 10-mtpa Calcasieu, which is expected to cost around $4.5 billion and start producing LNG in test mode in late 2021.
However, some buyers remained cautious.
“There is a lot of hype in the market and nobody knows for sure how long this supply crunch would last. For companies that do not have fresh demand in the next year or two, it’s better to wait,” said a separate Chinese importer.

"Global Gas Crisis Spilling Over Into Oil Markets, IEA Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) — Shortages of natural gas in Europe and Asia are boosting demand for oil, deepening what was already a sizable supply deficit in crude markets, the International Energy Agency said.
Crude has surged above $80/bbl, the highest in three years, as traders anticipated that record gas prices would stimulate consumption of other fuels, particularly for power generation. That’s already happening and could add about 500,000 bbls/d to oil use on average over the coming six months, the IEA said on Thursday. 
“An acute shortage of natural gas, LNG and coal supplies stemming from the gathering global economic recovery has sparked a precipitous run-up in prices for energy supplies and is triggering a massive switch to oil products,” the IEA said. “Provisional August data already indicates that there is some unseasonably high demand for fuel oil, crude and middle distillates for power plants across a number of countries, including China.”
The latest analysis from the agency shows how the acute shortage of natural gas is spilling over into other markets and the broader economy. The crisis is deepening the current oil-supply deficit, potentially disrupting OPEC’s careful plan to gradually revive idle production. It’s roiling energy-intensive industries and threatens to curb GDP growth and boost inflation.
The IEA raised its estimate for demand growth this year by 300,000 bbls/d to 5.5 million bbls/d, and increased it slightly for 2022 to 3.3 million bbls/d. The effect of oil-gas switching will mostly be felt this quarter and next, the agency said.
The gas crisis isn’t entirely a net positive for oil consumption. The increase in the IEA’s demand estimates was tempered by a weaker outlook for GDP resulting mainly from supply-chain issues and rising energy costs.
“The surge in prices has swept through the entire global energy chain,” the IEA said. “Higher energy prices are also adding to inflationary pressures that, along with power outages, could lead to lower industrial activity and a slowdown in the economic recovery.”
The agency noted that OPEC+ stuck to their plan to boost production by 400,000 bbls/d “despite calls from major consuming countries for a more substantial increase.”
OPEC+ showed no signs of deviating from its plan. Speaking at Russian Energy Week in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman reiterated his commitment to a gradual and phased revival of idle supply. The crisis engulfing other energy markets shows what a good job the group has done in regulating oil, he said.
Global oil production will rise by about 2.7 million bbls/d from September to the end of the year as OPEC+ continues to unwind its cuts and U.S. output recovers from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, the IEA said. Even with those additions, the market will be in a supply deficit of about 700,000 bbls/d for the rest of this year, before flipping back into surplus in early 2022, the IEA said.

"Coastal GasLink In Dispute With LNG Canada; Discussions Are Progressing, Says TC Energy | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Coastal GasLink is in dispute with LNG Canada with respect to recognition of certain costs and the impacts on the project schedule, TC Energy Corporation top brass told this morning’s second quarter conference call.
As a result of scope changes, permit delays and the impacts from COVID-19, including a provincial health order, TC Energy expects that project costs will increase significantly along with a delay to project completion compared to the original project cost and schedule.
“While commercial discussions are ongoing, and we remain committed to successfully completing the project, we are nearing a critical stage that requires resolution of the outstanding issues,” said François Poirier, president and chief executive officer. He noted that construction activities have resumed and the project is close to half finished.
However, if a resolution is not reached soon, then Coastal GasLink may suspend certain key construction activities, although crews would continue with safety and regulatory compliance-related work. The substance of a resolution with LNG Canada will determine any equity required to be contributed by Coastal GasLink LP partners — including TC Energy — needed to fund incremental costs.
In response to the pandemic, an order of the British Columbia Provincial Health Officer restricted the number of workers on industrial sites across northern B.C., including Coastal GasLink, and, as a result, only critical construction activities continued from December 2020 to early in the second quarter.
On April 13, the province lifted its health order, allowing for finalization of project remobilization plans for the summer construction program. In the absence of continued pipeline construction during the winter period, the project required major erosion and sediment control work.
Coastal GasLink has sought and will continue to mitigate cost increases and schedule delays, according to TC Energy management. Coastal GasLink expects incremental costs will be included in final pipeline tolls, subject to certain conditions.
“We’ve been in discussions for some time now, and those discussions do continue — they are confidential,” said Tracy Robinson, executive vice-president, president of Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines and Coastal GasLink. “We do have our equity partners involved. Because they’re all confidential, we’re unable to share any details at this time.
“I can say that [discussions] are progressing, but if we’re not able to reach a resolution in the near-term, then there will be some implications to our construction.”
Meanwhile, Coastal GasLink maintains access to a subordinated demand revolving facility with TC Energy that provides the project with additional short-term funding and financial flexibility and on which $220 million was drawn at June 30. Robinson noted the project, which is in full execution, employs more than 5,000 workers in the corridor. She is optimistic there will be a “fair and reasonable outcome” from ongoing discussions for the project.
If necessary, as an interim measure, the total amount of available credit facilities TC Energy provided to Coastal GasLink may be expanded so Coastal GasLink can access incremental short-term funding as a bridge to a required increase in project-level financing or project recoveries. Robinson added: “Execution is going well. We have a strong safety record. We want to continue to [conduct] construction.”

Tourmaline Q2 Output Surges | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Tourmaline Oil Corp.’s second quarter 2021 average production was 410,339 boe/d (414,387 boe/d prior to storage injections in California and Dawn), a 37 per cent increase over Q2 2020 (299,369 boe/d).
The company anticipates average third quarter production to range between 450,000 - 460,000 boe/d.
The company expects to reach the 500,000 boe/d production level in Q2 2022 primarily through the completion of Gundy Phase 2, the Nig Creek expansion, and the ongoing Laprise development program.
2021 average production of approximately 430,000 – 445,000 boe/d is anticipated, including all acquisitions and associated incremental capital spending on those assets.
Financial results
Second quarter 2021 cash flow was $570.2 million ($1.89 per diluted share) compared to $225.2 million (83 cents per diluted share) in Q2 2020.
Second quarter 2021 after tax net earnings were $420.8 million ($1.40 per diluted share) compared to $20.1 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in second quarter of 2020.
The company delivered free cash flow of $343.9 million on EP capital spending of $215.9 million in Q2 2021.
Full-year 2021 cash flow of $2.78 billion is now expected with estimated free cash flow of $1.47 billion.
Capital program and financial outlook
Second quarter 2021 EP capital spending was $215.9 million.
Full-year 2021 EP capital spending of $1.27 billion is currently expected.
Net debt at June 30, 2021, was $1.7 billion, which excludes the two NEBC transactions with Topaz Energy Corp., yielding $390 million in cash, both of which are expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.  Exit Q3 2021 expected net debt is approximately $1.4 billion, including the impact of all acquisitions completed to date in 2021.  The company now expects to achieve year-end 2021 net debt of approximately $1 billion (less than 0.4 times debt to cash flow, and less than one times annual FCF). 
As at July 15, 2021, Tourmaline's Topaz equity ownership was valued at $939.7 million, which essentially offsets the estimated 2021 year-end net debt.
The updated five-year plan, at current strip pricing, delivers $1.8 billion of FCF in 2022 and $7.0 billion over the full five-year duration of the plan.
Marketing update
Average realized natural gas price in Q2 2021 was $3.25/mcf as the company benefited from rising commodity prices, select hedging, and the company's broad natural gas market diversification portfolio throughout North America.
Following the Black Swan Energy acquisition, Tourmaline has an average of 822 mmcf/d hedged for 2021 at a weighted average fixed price of C$2.69/mcf, an average of 125 mmcf/d hedged at a basis to AECO of U.S. dollar $(0.35) /mcf and an average of 562 mmcf/d of incremental volume exposed to export markets, including Dawn, Iroquois, Empress/McNeill, Chicago, Ventura, Sumas, Malin, and PG&E.
With incremental volumes on the GTN Malin/PG&E system and the company's recently announced Gulf Coast LNG pathway in 2023, Tourmaline will have 905 mmcf/d exposed to export markets on firm, long-term transport agreements at exit 2023.
The accelerated Gundy Phase 2 expansion project is expected to be onstream in January 2022 so as to take advantage of potential winter gas price premiums.
The PG&E California market continues to be a very strong market with an average Q2 benchmark price of US$4.00/mmBtu and strip pricing at July 23, 2021 of $5.48/mmBtu for the remainder of 2021.
NGL price realizations in Q2 2021 were up 130 per cent over Q2 2020.  Tourmaline is Canada's largest NGL producer, averaging 55,543 bbls/d during the second quarter.

Pieridae Lowers Production Forecast | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Pieridae Energy Limited’s production forecast is now expected to be 40,000-42,500 boe/d for the remainder of 2021, compared to previous guidance of 40,000-45,000.
“We are guiding to a lower NOI [net operating income] in the range of $85-$100 million, down from the previous forecast of $100-$130 million,” said the company.
As well, adjusted operating expenses per boe are expected to increase from $9.50-$10.50 to $12.50-$13.00 primarily reflecting the increase in power prices and processing fees expected for the remainder of the year.
A previously stated development budget of $15-$20 million for the Goldboro LNG project is no longer being considered. The bulk of the company’s $35-$45 million upstream capital budget will continue to be invested to ensure the safe-reliable operation of its assets, including a fall turnaround at the Caroline Gas Complex.
Production for Q2 was 38,404 boe/d, down from 43,791 boe/d for the same period in 2020. Net loss was $10.06 million compared to a loss of $13.4 million the previous year. Funds flow was down at $8.52 million from $12.47 million.
In July, the company announced a strategic review process.

Latest Cost Estimate For Goldboro ‘Materially’ Higher From Original Price Tag: Pieridae CEO | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Pieridae Energy Limited’s top executive says the latest cost estimate for the East Coast Goldboro LNG project was “materially” higher than the original estimate of $10 billion and exceeded the company’s ability to get the needed financing.
In an interview, Alfred Sorensen, president and CEO, said the company will now retrench and look at alternatives which could include seeking ways to reduce costs, scaling down the project or finding a partner, which has proven impossible to date.
“The latest estimate was well over [$10 billion]. So it was materially different from what we were able to finance,” he said, although he did not offer a dollar figure from the new cost estimate.
“The whole commodity cycle right now is what it is. Everything coming out of this COVID thing — everything from cement to steel to copper — every major commodity you need to build one of these things are at historical highs,” Sorensen added.
“So we weren’t completely surprised that it came in at that price. The only part that’s kind of hard to figure out is our competitors continue to be under $1,000 a tonne. The part that’s really hard to understand is aren’t we all buying copper and steel in the same market place? But that’s what we have to do — we have to find a cheaper solution and one that Pieridae can finance.”
Attempts to secure a partner in the Goldboro project have not been successful and Pieridae’s lack of girth combined with the increased cost estimate forced the company to pause its efforts to move the project forward.
“I think we’ve known from the very beginning that Pieridae wasn’t big enough to pull this off. And as we went down the path of developing this project we always kind of hoped that we would get to find a partner. That just really hasn’t happened,” Sorensen said.
“Ever the optimists, we decided to continue to push forward and decided to go all the way to FID — or near FID — and a cost structure that was saleable. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. When we got our [latest] estimate it was really obvious that we were not able to get our costs under $1,000 a tonne,” he added.
“If you look at some of the other projects on the Gulf Coast that we basically compete against for capital, they’re all sub-$1,000 a tonne. Without a partner Pieridae didn’t have the capability to raise $10 billion plus in capital. So that’s why we put the project a little bit on hold right now and we’re looking at if we could either reduce costs … or focus on a smaller project versus the size it is right now.”

"New Project Cost Estimate, Access To Equity Will Determine Goldboro FID, Says Pieridae CEO | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
This is the first article in a series about various LNG projects running this week. 

Pieridae Energy Limited is in the homestretch in making its final investment decision (FID) on its East Coast Goldboro LNG project as the company is awaiting an updated cost estimate and continues to seek equity partners, says CEO Alfred Sorensen.
Engineering firm Bechtel Corp. planned to deliver a fixed-price proposal to build the plant by the end of May. The last cost estimate, conducted in 2016, pegged the price tag at $10 billion. Sorensen said FID is expected by the end of June.
“The big thing that is going to determine the FID decision is really kind of down to the final construction costs. We expect to receive that shortly from Bechtel. So that is the key thing. We got a preliminary number at the end of March and we have some work to do on that,” Sorensen said in an interview, adding the company is still looking for a number that lands in the $10 billion range.
“Assuming we get the number we’re looking for that we think is financeable and brings the returns that we need, our intended goal right now is to get to FID by the end of June. But that’s very much dependent on what that final construction cost number is,” he added.
“And secondly, we are quite focused on the equity raise right now and where the equity is going to come from to build the facility. We’ve seen some stuff that was leaked out of Nova Scotia, but we continue to kind of work on the equity angle. And those two things [project costs and the equity raise] are kind of coming together around the same time and they are the last two remaining hurdles to get to FID.”
The “leak” Sorensen referred to is in reference to media reports in mid-March that Pieridae had asked the Canadian federal government for $925 million in grants, loans, or loan guarantees to jumpstart the project. The CEO did confirm to the DOB that the company “approached” the federal government last year but did not offer further details.
One such media account, published by the CBC, said details of Pieridae Energy's apparent plan to request the money are contained in a PowerPoint presentation dated Dec. 16, 2020, that was leaked to an environmental group last month.
""This is a pivotal meeting today,"" reads one of the slides from the presentation materials. ""We hope to have a roadmap toward defining federal and provincial government financial support.
""Due to COVID and the inability to raise funds in the current state of energy markets in Canada and the U.S., government financial support is critical to moving the project forward.""
According to the CBC, a few slides later came the pitch: $925 million as a grant, repayable contribution or loan guarantee, broken down into staggered payments tied to pre-determined milestones.
At the time, Pieridae spokesperson James Millar told Canada’s national broadcaster the he couldn’t confirm the validity of the document. But in an interview, he touched on many points raised in the PowerPoint slides.
Millar confirmed the company was in talks with the federal government about financial support.
""But since we're in negotiations, I can't speak to details on any dollar amount,"" he said.
Goldboro is designed to produce about 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). Pieridae plans to source the gas for Goldboro from its production in Alberta and transport it via existing pipelines, including the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline from New England to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, which passes near the Goldboro site.
Pieridae has a 20-year agreement to sell all the LNG from Goldboro's first liquefaction train  ––  about five million mtpa or 0.66 bcf/d natural gas –– to German utility Uniper SE. If FID is positive, first LNG is expected in 2025-2026 timeframe.
Equity raise, prices impacted by COVID
Sorensen said that although equity-raising efforts have been somewhat hampered since the pandemic took hold, he remains optimistic that the company will be able to secure the needed financing.
“So far, it’s been going OK. COVID has made things harder because you can’t travel and we can’t meet face-to-face. So it’s a little harder to do a negotiation over Zoom or Teams or whatever.”
European natural gas pricing was also affected by the pandemic as demand slowed and prices fell. But that dynamic is improving, according to Sorensen.
“I would say that the last year has been difficult mainly because pricing was affected significantly by COVID. And now that we’re coming out the other side of it, you feel this pent up demand for commodities,” he said.
“I think the one thing is, if you’re looking at what makes our project work, it is sort of an $8.25 to $8.50 … price in Europe. And we continue to see price moving in that direction. There was good winter pricing. Summer pricing has come off but not nearly as much as you might think.”
Sorensen noted that the Goldboro project was “designed around the idea” that global natural gas pricing was “heading towards a more transparent, convergent natural gas price.”
And he believes there are signs of that occurring.
“I think the one thing that has now happened with COVID  ––  you might see some difference in timing between the Asian and European prices  ––  is they’ve certainly converged very quickly. Outside of a weather event, it’s kind of no different than in North America. In February when everything went to heck in a hand basket in the central part of the U.S. you had $300 natural gas there and $2 here,” Sorensen said.
“So things in natural gas [pricing] are always going to be a weather-related event, but the long-term pricing scenario  ––  whether you go to Asia or you go to Europe  ––  you’re going to get the same price on a long-term basis. So that part was always a part of our thesis on why it makes sense to build an LNG terminal on the East Coast of Canada because you didn’t have to go to Asia to get the highest price because the price would be the same,” he added.
“And I think that real-life fundamental has really crystallized significantly over the last year. And certainly, coming out of COVID we see, I think, a positive move toward where pricing needs to be to make our project work.”
And, according to Sorensen, that will play a vital role in determining the Goldboro project’s potential economic viability on a go-forward basis.
“This is why the final construction price tag will be interesting  ––  to see what it is  ––  because there has been a lot of pressure on commodities. We know about that when we’re talking about energy prices, but it’s also certainly important when you look at construction inputs, whether it’s lumber to build a house or steel to build an LNG project. They’ve all gone up significantly,” he said.
“It will be interesting to see if we can hold our $10-billion line. There are pluses and minuses and that’s what we’re working on right now.”
A different environment since last cost estimate
Sorensen said much has changed since Pieridae received its initial $10 billion cost estimate in 2016.
“The commodity market has changed a lot since our last estimate was done. The project originally kind of got off to a very good, fast start. We found a customer, we got the environmental processes done relatively successfully and that left nothing but pricing issues of either crude oil or natural gas,” he said.
“And certainly by the [2019 period] we saw gas prices so low here that attracting new investment was virtually impossible. And that’s really why we approached the Government of Canada last year. It was because  ––  and I’m a taxpayer, too, and I don’t have any interest in seeing our government funding business  –– but our scenario was kind of ‘do we keep the project alive or do we kill it?’
“And regardless of what happens there, the equity side of our story is also a big part of our FID decision. And that’s why there is a timing difference between the end of May [when the revised cost estimate is expected] and the end of June. We roughly have 30 days to wrap up the equity side of it.”
The bigger picture: LNG market ‘starting to change’
Sorensen noted that, on a global scale, the LNG industry was likely permanently altered because of the pandemic as many proposed greenfield projects fell by the wayside, including Chevron Corporation’s announcement in March that it will cease further company-funded feasibility work for the Kitimat LNG project.
“I think if you take a world view there are many projects that have been cancelled during the COVID process. And I think you’ve even seen in North America that many projects have already disappeared. I think that is the market. I do think the market is starting to change,” he said.
But not necessarily, he added, in an entirely negative fashion. Especially for already entrenched projects capable of executing brownfield expansions, at some point, to existing facilities.
“I actually had a call just recently from a very large European utility that really showed no interest in our project before. They actually called us to see how they might be able to get involved with us and our project,” Sorensen said.
“So I think the market is changing, which is important whether it’s Kitimat or it’s Rockies LNG or if it’s anyone else. Without a market it’s going to be hard to get those projects over the line. I think you’ve seen that with the [Woodside Petroleum Limited]-Chevron project: that it’s all about market,” he added.
“And I think the fact that Chevron and Woodside are also partners in Australia, I think that they are probably finding now that it’s probably easier to do a brownfield expansion in Australia than to build a greenfield in Canada. And I think that’s why, if market demand continues to grow, it will go first to LNG Canada before it will go to a new project, in my view.”
And Sorensen said that logic could also eventually apply to Pieridae and the Goldboro project.
“That’s because we have an anchor with Uniper. And you see that because that’s why people are calling us now. That’s because Mozambique looks like it might fall over and it was supposed to be the new LNG nirvana. The Gulf Coast is probably maxed out,” he said.
“There really isn’t any new projects coming on in that 2025-26 period now because we’ve gone two years  ––  or maybe closer to three  ––  with no FID. And the market is going to be short because it will be more and more into natural gas.”

Sabine 6 LNG Export Unit Moves Closer To Entering Service | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — U.S. energy regulators on Wednesday gave Cheniere Energy Inc. permission to introduce feedgas to commission parts of the sixth liquefaction train at the company’s Sabine Pass LNG export plant in Louisiana.
The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval was in response to Cheniere’s Sept. 15 request. Feedgas is the natural gas from pipelines that the plant will turn into LNG.
Cheniere has said it expects Train 6 will enter commercial service in early 2022, but analysts note the unit will likely start producing LNG in test mode later this year.
Cheniere is the biggest LNG exporter in the United States and is also the country’s biggest buyer of natural gas.
In addition to Sabine, which will have the capacity to produce around 30 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG once Train 6 enters service, Cheniere also owns the three-train, 15-MTPA Corpus Christi LNG export plant in Texas.

"U.S. Natgas Hit 7-Year High On Gulf Storm Worries, Soaring Global Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures climbed to a fresh seven-year high on Tuesday on worries Tropical Storm Nicholas could delay the already slow return of production in the Gulf of Mexico and as record global gas prices keep demand for U.S. exports high.
Prices rose despite forecasts for less hot weather and lower demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.
Traders noted storms in the Gulf of Mexico, like Nicholas and Hurricane Ida, could boost gas prices by cutting Gulf Coast production. But, they can also reduce demand and cut prices by disrupting LNG exports and knocking out power to homes and businesses, especially the petrochemical facilities that use lots of gas.
The center of Nicholas was located about 25 kilometres south-southwest of Houston and could cause life-threatening flash floods across the Deep South during the next couple of days, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm has already knocked out power to around 500,000 customers in Texas, but so far has not had much of an impact on the region's LNG and nuclear power plants.  
Front-month gas futures rose 4.9 cents, or 0.9 per cent, to $5.28/mmBtu at 9:21 a.m. EDT (1321 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since February 2014 for a second day in a row.
Since Hurricane Ida entered the Gulf of Mexico in late August, gas prices have soared over 32 per cent due mostly to the slow return of production after the storm. Traders said gas prices have also been supported by hotter than normal U.S. weather and high air conditioning demand this summer, record global gas prices, and lower than normal gas inventories in the United States and Europe ahead of the winter heating season when demand for the fuel peaks.
Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell to an average of 90.1 bcf/d so far in September, from 92.0 bcf/d in August, due mostly to Ida-related losses along the Gulf Coast. That compares with a monthly record of 95.4 bcf/d in November 2019.
About 1.2 bcf/d, or 52 per cent, of gas production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains shut-in since Ida, according to government data.  
Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 86.8 bcf/d this week to 87.1 bcf/d next week as heating demand picks up in some regions. Those forecasts, however, were lower than Refinitiv expected on Monday.
The amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 10.9 bcf/d so far in September, from 10.5 bcf/d in August, as buyers around the world keep purchasing all the super-chilled gas the United States can produce. That compares with a monthly record of 11.5 bcf/d in April.
Gas in Europe and Asia was trading around $23 and $19/mmBtu, respectively, compared with just $5 for the U.S. fuel. Gas at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands, the European benchmark, was at a record high.

PETRONAS Plans To Scale Up CCS At Kasawari Gas Field | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — PETRONAS plans to scale up a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project as part of the second phase of development at the Kasawari gas field off Sarawak, its CEO said.
The CCS project at the field, which is estimated to hold three tcf of gas reserves, is key to the state energy firm's plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
""This will potentially be one of the world's largest CCS projects,"" CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Aziz said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday at the Reuters Impact conference.
It will be able to capture more than 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, he said.
""It's a tricky project because it needs to deal with our own system requirements,"" he said.
""It is something that we think can be scaled up in phase two,"" he said, but declined to elaborate on the potential cost involved as the project will have to be tendered out.
While profitable and scalable CCS projects remain scarce, Taufik said he was confident that the planned stream of global investments in CCS will make it a viable means for energy firms to curb emissions.
""There are many, many projects in place in Scandinavia, our counterparts in Norway, and we've also got a template out in Australia where CCS has been deployed,"" he said.
""The question is whether the scale is large enough to make it economic.""
The Kasawari project will also ensure that PETRONAS remains one of the world's top five exporters of LNG, Taufik said.
Global gas demand accelerated this year with Asia spot prices LNG-AS hitting all-time highs as economies recover from the pandemic.
""The reality is, in any projections, even IEA's most aggressive projections of renewables displacement, we will still need hydrocarbons to be part of the energy mix,"" Taufik said, adding that natural gas will account for about a quarter of the world's energy demand.
""Many of us, my counterparts and I, believe that CCS will be part of the solution to decarbonize the extraction of hydrocarbons,"" he said.
PETRONAS is also looking at offering CCS as a solution for power and the cement, steel and chemicals sectors which are facing challenges in reducing billions of tonnes of emissions, Taufik said, adding that carbon taxes and carbon pricing will be key in making these projects economical.
He declined to comment on the carbon price that PETRONAS applies to its projects.

Chinese Buyers Seek To Boost LNG Imports For Winter Despite Record Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Chinese buyers are seeking more liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes despite record prices, bidding above market rates as the winter season starts with the country’s gas inventory low, several trade sources told Reuters.
China, which has this year overtaken Japan as the world’s top buyer of LNG, is grappling with its worst power outages in years in the northeast, triggered by coal shortages.
This in turn is pushing up demand for natural gas in power generation as Beijing orders energy and power companies to ensure sufficient supplies to avoid outages during winter when heating supply is crucial, the sources said.
“Chinese buyers have been asking and buying cargoes for winter and have been indicating prices at above market rates,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said.
“In this market, there is no choice except to pay up to secure cargoes.”
Spot Asian LNG prices surged to a record high of $34.47/mmBtu on Thursday, up more than 500 per cent from the same period last year.
Typically, when spot prices surge, price-sensitive Chinese buyers would shun buying from spot market. But last week, Unipec, the trading arm of China’s Sinopec, sought 11 LNG cargoes for winter and likely bought more than it required, traders said.
The state energy firm said on Thursday that it planned to import 13.3 billion cubic metres (bcm) of LNG this winter — about nine per cent higher than imports last winter — to operate its existing terminals at full capacity, and accelerate adding gas storage by the end of October.
Other Chinese majors including China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) and PetroChina are also seeking cargoes to be delivered in winter, several trade sources said.
Gas inventory in China is at below average levels at some terminals, one trader said, citing private industry data, which is also stoking fears of further supply crunch within China.
However, the sharp spike in prices is keeping second-tier gas importers — which are mostly city-gas firms — at bay, the traders added.
With international gas prices currently about double domestic ones, these firms risk making huge losses when they sell to domestic consumers, they said.
To mitigate losses, China’s finance ministry said on Thursday it will speed up approvals for value-added tax rebates on natural gas imports, to help boost winter energy supplies.
The potential financial risk could also be driving Chinese state majors to step up and procure cargoes to ensure there is enough supply during winter and ahead of the Winter Olympics to be held in February, they added.
CNOOC earlier this week signed a long-term deal with Qatar Petroleum, with supplies expected to start in January, which may also help meet demand.
Spot prices started surging during summer in the northern hemisphere amid hot weather and competition from Europe for LNG as gas inflows to the region slowed due to maintenance.
Buyers in Asia, including China, had kept purchases at a minimum hoping prices would drop in the off-peak season of September-October, but that never happened.
“China definitely does not have enough gas for winter. The question is whether this is going to cause demand destruction in the form of more power cuts,” a Singapore-based trader said.

Russia Says Nord Stream 2 Clearance May Cool Gas Prices In Europe | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that certification of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline, which expects clearance from a Germany's regulator, could cool soaring European gas prices.
Prices have spiked in response to a recovery in demand, particularly from Asia, when storage levels are low.
""I think there are two factors, which could somewhat cool off the current situation. First of all, of course, this is, definitely, completion of certification and the fastest clearance for gas supplies via the completed Nord Stream 2,"" Novak told a meeting of government officials and heads of energy companies.
Nord Stream 2, which runs on the bed of the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, is expecting certification from Germany, which could take a few months. The pipeline has faced resistance from the United States, which says the project will increase Europe's reliance on Russian energy.
Novak said an increase in gas sales on Gazprom's Electronic Sales Platform could also calm prices. Gazprom set up the ESP in 2018 for gas sales to Europe to supplement the existing long and mid-term contracts. It has suspended gas sales for delivery in 2022 since late August.
President Vladimir Putin, who chaired the meeting, has agreed with the proposed increase, adding that Russia should meet its domestic gas needs first.
Novak said some speculative trade could also be behind the soaring gas prices, which he said did not reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand.
Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, at the meeting asked Putin for the right to export natural gas from Russia. State television did not air Putin's reaction to the request.
Long-term deals
Putin told the meeting that Europe was wrong to reduce the share of long-term deals in natural gas trade in favour of the spot market instead, where prices have surged.
""We talked to the European Commission's previous lineup, and all its activity was aimed at phasing out of so-called long-term contracts,"" he said.
""It was aimed at transition to spot gas trade. And as it turned out, it has become obvious today, that this practice is a mistake.""
Gazprom has resisted moving to spot trade in Europe, preferring long-term deals, which sometimes last around 25 years.
Putin also reiterated that Russia has been a reliable energy supplier to Europe, which may see record-high Russian gas exports this year as Moscow is increasing gas supplies, including via Ukraine, in response to the energy crunch and stands ready to stabilize the market.
He said that Russian gas transit via Ukraine is set to exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom's contract with Kyiv.
Kremlin denial
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had absolutely no role in causing Europe's surging gas prices, following accusations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some in the European Parliament that Russia had not done enough to increase supplies to Europe.
""There are a couple of reasons [behind the gas crisis] — the way the economy is recovering, how demand for the energy resources is growing, as well gas storages are not filled in,"" Peskov told reporters on a daily conference call.
Putin also cited economic recovery and cold weather in Europe, which led to a reduction in gas storage as another reason behind the gas prices surge.
Peskov said Moscow was ready to discuss new long-term contracts for gas sales to European consumers and that Gazprom was meeting all its obligations.

Southwest Gas To Buy Questar For $2B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Southwest Gas Holdings Inc. said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Questar Pipelines from Dominion Energy for $1.975 billion, hours after activist investor Carl Icahn made public his objections to it.
For Southwest Gas, paying $1.545 billion in cash and assuming $430 million of debt, the acquisition marks a northward expansion of its operations and boosts its regulated business.
""The acquisition ... will provide significant financial and strategic benefits to our company, shareholders, employees and partners,"" said Southwest Gas chief executive John Hester, adding the deal would be accretive to earnings per share in 2022.
The announcement confirmed a Reuters report from Sunday, saying Southwest Gas was in advanced talks to acquire Questar, citing people familiar with the matter.
Referencing the article in a letter to Southwest Gas's board, released earlier on Tuesday and detailing he holds a large stake in the company, Icahn said the acquisition would seriously diminish shareholder value and urged its abandonment.
Southwest Gas should instead focus on improving share price performance, which lagged peers, said the investor who has a history of agitating against U.S. utilities.  
Given Southwest Gas is paying cash, its shareholders will not vote on approving the acquisition, as they would if the company was issuing a large amount of stock to finance it.
For Dominion, the divestment comes after a previous attempt to sell Questar to the energy arm of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was called off in July over uncertainty whether antitrust regulators would approve it.  
In its own statement, Dominion said proceeds would pay down debt and support spending plans. The deal will close before year-end, subject to regulatory approval.
Questar Pipelines provides interstate natural gas transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.  
Southwest Gas serves more than two million customers in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Investment bank Lazard and law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP worked on the deal for Southwest Gas. Dominion received financial and legal advice from, respectively, Barclays and McGuireWoods LLP.

Peyto’s Q2 Drilling Program Less Active Than Expected But Production ‘Held Up Pretty Well’ | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.’s second quarter production “held up pretty well” despite the seasonal impacts of spring breakup and the loss of two rigs during the period due to maintenance and upgrades that took longer than anticipated to complete, says president and CEO Darren Gee.
“Operationally, drilling and completions were very successful in the quarter with breakup obviously shutting it down in the middle of the quarter. I think breakup this year was more or less normal in terms of how long we had to stay shutdown,” Gee told a second quarter conference call this morning.
“We did shut two rigs down during breakup for maintenance and upgrades and that kept them on the sidelines unfortunately longer than we had hoped. We were getting some upgrades that were making them more efficient, so we’re happy to see that but we were hoping to get them back to work a little sooner than that.”
That said, the company increased second quarter output to 88,738 boe/d, an increase of 14 per cent from 78,097 boe/d during the comparable period last year.
Production during the recently completed period was comprised of 459 mmcf/d of natural gas, 7,253 bbls/d of condensate and pentanes, and 5,036 bbls/d of butane and propane. Total liquid yields of 26.8 bbls/mmcf, or 14 per cent of total production, was down from 27.7 bbls/mmcf in Q2 2020 due to an increased focus on leaner gas production.
Gee said Peyto came back from spring breakup trailing its planned capital program and drilling schedule. But the company plans to make that up during the second half of the year.
“And that combined with some unexpected participation by one of our partners meant that our net drilling activity was a little more behind than what we were scheduling in Q2 and we want to catch up to that so we’ve added a fifth rig at the start of August. And that fifth rig should help us catch up even more than we missed there by the end of the year,” he said, adding the company expects to exit 2021 with production around 100,000 boe/d.
So we’ll be in position going into the winter for some strong gas prices.”
The company invested $57 million in organic activity. A total of 15 (13.4 net working interest) wells were drilled in the second quarter, 14 (13.3 net) wells were completed, and 14 (13.3 net) wells were brought on production.
Over the last 12 months new production additions, inclusive of acquisitions, accounted for approximately 30,000 boe/d at the end of the quarter, which, when combined with a trailing 12-month capital investment of $296 million, equates to an annualized capital efficiency of $9,900/boe/d. Peyto anticipates full-year 2021 capital efficiency will be less than $9,000/boe/d.
Broken down, during the second quarter of 2021 Peyto invested $28 million on drilling, $15 million on completions, $4 million on wellsite equipment and tie-ins, $8 million on facilities and major pipeline projects, and $2 million acquiring new lands and seismic.
In addition, the company purchased 80 ultra low emissions wellsite packages and 30 kilometres of new pipe which added $5.4 million to capital inventory. This equipment, which will serve new drilling until the summer of 2022, was ordered early to avoid cost inflation.
As stated above, Peyto invested $8 million in facilities and major pipeline projects to continue to build out its midstream assets. This included condensate stabilization at its Brazeau gas plant, pipeline expansion work in Brazeau, Cecilia and Wildhay areas, and additional methane emissions reduction projects at individual wellsites across the Greater Sundance area.
Second quarter 2021 activity was spread across the multiple stacked Cretaceous formations and throughout Peyto’s Deep Basin core areas.
“In general, I would say well results continued to come in better than expected, particularly our extended reach horizontals that we’re doing and our drilling down in the Chamber area has been very successful,” Gee said.
Drilling costs per metre and completion costs per stage continued to fall as Peyto drilled another five extended reach horizontal (ERH) wells in the quarter. The five wells averaged over 5,600 metres of total measured depth with average horizontal laterals in excess of 2,500 metres.
These ERH wells allow Peyto to access more reservoir and develop more reserves per wellbore, thus minimizing both cost and environmental impact, while the lower per metre costs help offset any service cost inflation.
Activity update
Since the end of the quarter, the company has drilled 10 (9.6 net) wells, completed 11 (9.8 net) wells, and brought onstream nine (7.8 net) new wells. Six (six net) wells are drilled and awaiting completion.
To catch up from second quarter 2021 drilling delays, Peyto contracted a fifth drilling rig which began operations at the start of August. Development results from this rig are also expected to contribute additional gas production to take advantage of strong winter natural gas prices.
Drilling will continue to focus on the many Deep Basin horizons across the company’s greater Sundance area, including its Cecilia acquisition, and in its Brazeau area. The company is still targeting year end exit production of 100,000 boe/d.
Recent success on the acquired Cecilia lands has grown production from 2,900 boe/d to over 7,000 boe/d. Pipeline interconnections are allowing area production to be diverted to the Cecilia gas plant, Wildhay gas plant or Oldman gas plants where over 100 mmcf/d of available capacity exists. These interconnections will provide processing flexibility for unexpected outages and during facility turnarounds.
Additional success in Peyto’s south Brazeau area, called Chambers, has prompted the company to design a new, sweet, gas processing plant for this area. Currently, production travels 36 kilometres north through various pipelines before being processed at the Peyto Brazeau gas plant which is less hydraulically and environmentally efficient.
This new Chambers gas plant is designed for 50 mmcf/d of gas processing and 2,000 bbls/d of condensate stabilization, with expansion capability to 100 mmcf/d and 4,000 bbls/d. Most of the equipment for the new plant will be sourced from existing surplus inventory with some minor equipment being repurposed from existing gas plants.
The location of the new gas plant will be directly adjacent to NGTL’s Mainline pipeline system. Peyto envisions this new, state of the art facility will include the latest low emissions technology, employing compressor vent gas capture and BTEX vapour recovery units, waste heat recovery, and zero emissions controllers and instrumentation.
The existing gathering system will interconnect both the Brazeau and Chambers gas plants providing additional flexibility. Construction of the new plant will begin in the fall of 2021 with commissioning in Q1 2022. Peyto estimates 140 temporary and five full-time jobs will be created with this investment.
Select financial highlights
Funds from operations (FFO) were up 149 per cent to $82 million from $33 million in Q2 2020 due to higher commodity price realizations combined with higher production, despite a $22 million realized hedging loss in the quarter.
FFO in the quarter exceeded capital expenditures by $25 million. This represents a free cash flow ratio of over 30 per cent of FFO while dividends of $1.7 million in the quarter represent a payout ratio of two per cent.
The company generated earnings of $12.76 million versus a loss of $22.54 million during the comparable period last year.
Peyto’s unhedged realized natural gas price for the quarter was up 57 per cent from Q2 2020, before hedging and market diversification costs, while its unhedged realized oil and NGL price was up 189 per cent.
Combined, Peyto’s realized revenue after hedging losses and market diversification costs was up 69 per cent from $1.73/mcfe in Q2 2020 to $2.92/mcfe in Q2 2021 driving the 149 per cent increase in FFO per share.
Cash costs before royalties were held constant from the prior year period other than a $0.05/mcfe increase in transportation tolls, resulting in a 120 per cent improvement in cash netback.
During Q2 2021, Peyto sold 52 per cent of its natural gas at Henry Hub, 28 per cent at AECO, eight per cent at Emerson, eight per cent at Malin, and the remaining four per cent at Ventura. Approximately 50 per cent of AECO sales were at Daily prices while 50 per cent were at monthly prices.
Net of diversification activities of C$1.29/mcf (US$1.01/mmBtu), Peyto realized a natural gas price of $2.39/mcf before commodity risk management reduced this price by $0.33/mcf to $2.06/mcf.

Pipestone Expansion Likely For Tidewater; Company Sees Higher Revenue For Q2 2021 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
It is more likely than not that Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. will be expanding its Pipestone Gas Plant, based on recent throughput at the facility, says Joel MacLeod, chief executive officer.
“It’s great to see our customers performing well at Pipestone,” he told last week’s second quarter conference call. “I’d hate to say it’s a 100-per-cent probability, as there’s nothing that’s 100-per-cent probability, but we’d definitely probably be above a 50-per-cent probability now of a Pipestone expansion.
“Definitely, there’s more work to be done in understanding capital costs. Do we need a new gathering line, or do we just need capital at the plant? Definitely there’s some work to be done.”
Pipestone processed an average volume of 92 mmcf/d in Q2 2021, which is up 19 per cent from Q2 2020. Facility availability for the quarter averaged 94 per cent. During the month of May, the plant’s average daily throughput was 100 mmcf/d, combined with 100-per-cent facility availability.
MacLeod added: “I’d say the probability [of an expansion] is going up, and we’re hopeful into the end of the year that it becomes a real opportunity that we can move forward with.”
Q2 results
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, Tidewater recorded revenue of $369.78 million and $729.82 million, respectively, which is up 107 and 69 per cent from the same prior-year periods, driven by stronger year-over-year commodity prices. The Prince George Refinery saw strong utilization and throughput during the second quarter, while gasoline and diesel margins improved when compared to the same three-month period last year.
For the refinery in Prince George, in Q2 2021, total throughput was at about 95 per cent of the refinery’s nameplate capacity at roughly 11,460 bbl/d. Throughput during Q2 2021 was about eight per cent higher compared to Q2 2020.
At the Brazeau River Complex’s gas processing facility, throughput during Q2 2021 was consistent with the previous quarter. Strong AECO prices over the past six months have increased producer activity near the complex, according to management. Tidewater continues to seek out opportunities to increase third-party plant throughput, working diligently with producers to improve netbacks by utilizing its Brazeau facilities.
The Brazeau River fractionation facility performed well in Q2 2021, despite a 400 bbl/d throughput reduction due to third-party turnarounds and maintenance activities.
Decreased volumes were offset with strong NGL netbacks improving the frac spread margins realized at the company’s extraction facilities. During the second quarter of 2021, new agreements were signed with several investment grade counterparties for NGL service at Brazeau.
Adjusted EBITDA totalled roughly $52.29 million and $103.41 million in Q2 and the first half of this year, respectively, which is up 25 and 24 per cent from those same prior-year periods. Net income was $64.28 million and $72.68 million in 2021’s second quarter and first two quarters, respectively, compared to net income of $1.11 million and a $37.03 million net loss for the same 2020 periods.
Management attributes increased net income for the quarter to non-cash unrealized gains on derivative contracts, increased realized gains on derivative contracts, as well as realized gains on the sale of assets. Operating expenses were $335.3 million and $648.1 million in Q2 and the first half of 2021, respectively, which is up 133 and 82 per cent from the same prior-year periods, largely related to strengthening commodity prices coming out of the COVID-19 downturn.
Tidewater Renewables
Through its wholly-owned Tidewater Renewables Ltd. subsidiary, the company has begun engineering and construction on its renewable diesel and renewable hydrogen complex. Management anticipates a final investment decision during this year’s third quarter, with commissioning expected in Q1 2023.
Late last month, Tidewater announced the creation of Tidewater Renewables to serve as a “multi-faceted, energy-transition company” focused on producing low-carbon fuels.
“The creation of, and initial public offering of, Tidewater Renewables is the result of a thorough evaluation of financing alternatives, with the goal of funding the Tidewater Renewables portfolio of clean-fuel projects, while allowing Tidewater to continue to deleverage through 2021,” said MacLeod. “We have seen significant institutional support, and we expect to close the IPO in August.
“With the formation of Tidewater Renewables, $40 million of EBITDA will be dropped down into Tidewater Renewables from Tidewater Midstream.”
He added: “The Tidewater Renewables IPO enables the final investment decision of our renewable diesel and renewable hydrogen complex, which when accompanied with our two co-processing projects provided a view to roughly $150 million of EBITDA within Tidewater Renewables in 2023.”
Tidewater will retain approximately 70-per-cent ownership of Tidewater Renewables, which will be a high-growth renewables business unit within the larger company.

Pembina Pipeline Boosts 2021 EBITDA Guidance; Company Increases Revenue For Q2 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Pembina Pipeline Corporation has updated its full-year EBITDA guidance for 2021 to between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, raising the low-end, based on year-to-date results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
“Clearly, raising the lower end is a good thing,” Mick Dilger, president and chief executive officer, told this morning’s Q2 results conference call. “I know some analysts were hoping we’d raise the top end, but it’s still pretty early in the year. I sure don’t know what I’m going to read in the newspaper next week, and so there are still a lot of moving pieces. We just didn’t think there was compelling evidence to do more than what we’ve done.”
The company continues to “build throughout the year,” he noted, and some customers’ Q2 results suggest capital spending increases could result in further EBITDA guidance increases for Pembina. “We’re starting to see people drill one extra pad, for example. One extra pad can mean 100 mmcf/d of gas and 20,000 bbls/d of liquids. Those things do matter, and people are reaching their debt targets earlier, and they’re buying back their shares.”
Digler added: “As the generalists step into this space, and share prices go up, at some point there’s a tipping point where producers are going to start to drill because that’s a better investment than their shares.”
In Q2 and the first half of 2021, Pembina volumes were 3.5 million and 3.49 million boe/d, respectfully, compared to 3.43 million and 3.47 million boe/d in the same 2020 periods, due to higher pipeline volumes. Pipelines volumes of 2.63 million boe/d in Q2 represent a three-per-cent increase compared to the same prior-year period, largely driven by higher interruptible volumes on Peace Pipeline and Cochin Pipeline, and higher Alliance Pipeline seasonal volumes.
Offsetting these increases were lower interruptible volumes on Vantage Pipeline, as market conditions exist for end users to source supply from the Redwater Complex, and lower volumes on Ruby Pipeline due to contract expirations.
Pembina participated in three transformational partnerships during the second quarter, including with the Haisla Nation to develop the proposed Cedar LNG project and Chinook Pathways, a partnership with Western Indigenous Pipeline Group to pursue ownership of the Trans Mountain pipeline, as well as an Alberta Carbon Grid vision.
“Collectively, the partnerships support Pembina’s global market-access strategy, allow for meaningful Indigenous participation in Canadian energy development, and provide [key] large-scale infrastructure platforms to assist Alberta-based industries to manage their greenhouse-gas emissions and contribute to a lower-carbon economy,” Dilger said.
The firm continues to defer its Prince Rupert Terminal expansion. Engineering of the expansion is well advanced and Pembina expects to make a final investment decision in Q1 2022. Meanwhile, last month, Pembina terminated its arrangement agreement with Inter Pipeline Ltd. Pembina received a $350 million termination fee. Management is looking at how best to spend that money, including business reinvestment, debt repayment and share buybacks.
“Execution of Pembina’s long-term strategy is never reliant on a single investment,” added the CEO. “The record continues to show that while investments may be a tool to execute our strategy, we will remain disciplined, prioritizing shareholder returns on our financial guard rails.”
Q2 results
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, Pembina recorded total revenue of $1.95 billion and $4 billion, respectively, which is up 54 and 36 per cent from the same periods last year.
“Similar to what we’ve seen in our year-to-date results, growing confidence in our 2021 outlook reflects stronger-than-expected full-year marketing results, net of significant realized hedging losses and the modestly higher volumes across many Pembina Pipeline systems and facilities,” Dilger told the conference call.
“While supporting Pembina’s 2021 guidance update, stronger commodity prices and rising volumes also means Pembina’s customers are in ever-better financial positions, generating significant free cash flow and improving their balance sheets, with many reaching leverage targets earlier than expected, which sets the stage for increased drilling activity and increased capital spending by producers into 2022, with positive implications for Pembina’s business.”
Adjusted EBITDA totalled $778 million and $1.61 billion in Q2 and the first half of 2021, respectively, compared to $789 million and $1.62 billion last year. Increased realized loss on commodity-related derivatives offset higher margins on natural gas liquids and crude sales, as well as the positive impact of higher marketed NGL volumes.
Further, management attributes lower year-over-year EBITDA to less Edmonton South Rail Terminal revenue, due to an $11 million non-recurring leasing adjustment made in Q2 2020, the impact of a lower U.S. dollar exchange rate, higher power costs, a portion of which were not recoverable in revenue, as well as higher G&A expenses.
Higher G&A costs are due to higher long-term incentive costs driven by Pembina’s increasing share price in Q2 2021 compared to a decreasing share price in Q2 2020, partially offset by a reduction in salaries and wages.
Offsetting these EBITDA-decreasing factors was strong performance from existing assets along with Prince Rupert Terminal, Empress Infrastructure and Duvernay III being placed into service in Facilities, as well as higher interruptible volumes on the Peace Pipeline system.
As for earnings for the second quarter and first six months of this year, respectively, they were $254 million and $574 million, compared to earnings of $258 million and $577 million in the same 2020 timeframes. Lower unrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives and lower current tax expense as a result of lower taxable income, combined with a reduction in Alberta’s corporate tax rate from 10 to eight per cent effective July 2020, positively impacted earnings.
However, Q2 2021 earnings were negatively impacted by lower income received associated with the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) program, an increase in acquisition related costs, as well as lower share of profit from the Ruby Pipeline, and an increase in net finance costs due to second quarter losses on non-commodity-related derivative financial instruments compared to gains recognized in Q2 2020.
“Our second quarter is usually our weakest quarter,” Dilger said. “Last year was kind of anomalous because we made all of our storage revenue in one month, versus rateably through the year. We feel pretty good about the way the year is going to finish. We’ve seen some nice signs.”
Pipeline project updates
During the quarter, Pembina reactivated Phase IX, which will accommodate increased activity in the northeastern B.C.’s Montney play. The company has revised project estimated cost of approximately $120 million, which reflects the addition of a Wapiti-to-Kakwa corridor pump station, offset by cost savings identified through value engineering. Management expects Phase IX to have an in-service date in the second half of 2022.
Also, Pembina continues to progress its Phase VII Peace Pipeline expansion, which will add about 160,000 bbls/d of incremental capacity upstream of Fox Creek, accessing capacity available on mainlines downstream. The company completed all major procurement activities by the end of Q2. Construction is underway and progressing according to schedule. The project has a $775 million capital budget and has an expected in-service date in the first half of 2023.
Meanwhile, the previously-announced Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion remains deferred. Initial contracts supporting the project remain intact and customers continue to signal plans which will necessitate the incremental capacity. Value engineering work is ongoing and Pembina continues to evaluate this project in discussions with its producing customers with a reactivation decision expected in Q4 2021.
Supporting Phase IX and potential Phase VIII reactivation, Pembina entered into an exclusivity agreement with (and concurrently provided an irrevocable offer for), midstream services to a premiere Montney producer. The deal provides a bridge to negotiation of definitive agreements for transportation and fractionation of a material volume of liquids and NGL mix from certain lands in northeastern B.C.
Pembina and the producer will work to develop and execute definitive agreements by year-end 2021. All new firm transportation and fractionation services provided in the proposed arrangement will be supported by long-term, take-or-pay agreements. Prior to deferral, Phase VIII had an associated capital cost of approximately $500 million, but Pembina expects this level of investment to decrease given cost and scope improvements.

"Making The Steel Grade: Tenaris Introduces Canada-Produced Design, Fit For The Montney | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Tenaris SA has tailor engineered, in Canada, a new proprietary seamless steel grade — TN 80EY — that is ideal for Montney conditions, says a company representative.
“We have been working on this for the past couple of years, seeing a need as you see more development in those shale areas,” Shellie Clark, commercial vice-president at Tenaris, told the Bulletin. “There’s opportunity elsewhere in the world, but we’ve consolidated a lot of efforts from groups around the world to build this for Canada.”
According to the company, its new steel grade, built at the Sault Ste. Marie facility, is applicable in severe sour conditions often associated with unconventional shale environments, and is adaptable to high contents of hydrogen sulphide, which is relevant for many Canadian pipeline customers. The new steel grade provides an improved burst compared to the L80-ICY steel grade, and it is a cost-competitive alternative to API T95.
“To date, there have only been two options available for sour areas — areas such as the Montney shale gas and unconventional areas in Canada,” Clark said, highlighting that one current option is below requirements, while the other is too high-spec. “This [new] product is now providing an option for those operators. It’s basically more custom made.”
She added: “It’s purpose-built for these mid-range-type parts of the reservoir, where in the end it’s a more cost-effective solution for the customer.”
When developing TN 80EY, Tenaris considered unique National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Region 3 challenges, such as physical phenomenon associated with sour service environments known as sulfide stress cracking or H2S embrittlement.
The product is not a pipeline grade, noted Clark, but is a grade of steel specifically used in well construction. “And so, you install casing in the hole, and you produce through that.”
The competition
Although there is probably a similar product available in the market to the TN 80EY steel grade, noted Clark, that would be an imported product, and one that is not manufactured in a controlled process, but rather identified as having the desired characteristics from sorting stacks of pipe, and then set aside. “They can’t verify and control the reliability and mechanical specs, essentially, through the product.”
By comparison, she told the DOB, Tenaris’s newly-developed steel grade is a mechanically-engineered, controlled product, which is better and safer for sour applications. “We worked directly with our customers, and this is a benefit to them of being able to work with the mill. That’s a distinct difference to competitive products currently out there.”
She added: “The other thing too is that we’re manufacturing this in Canada for our Canadian customers. And so, it’s unique that way. Because of that, we’re able to respond much more quickly to their lead times, which is also an attractive alternative.”
New investments
Late last year, Tenaris announced plans to transform its industrial operations to preserve long-term sustainability and growth in Canada, thanks in part to a $9 million Ontario government investment in Tenaris Algoma Tubes that leverages more than $117 million in private sector investments, creating 153 high-paying local jobs. Tenaris Algoma Tubes manufactures seamless oil country tubular goods (OCTG) and line-pipe products for the oil and gas sector.
Development of the TN 80EY product is in addition to the recent investment, noted Clark, although she said that investment probably aligns with why the company is making this new product for its customers. “We’re increasing our product portfolio, and ensuring that we can produce more in Canada for Canada. By the end of that investment, we will be able to produce about 90 per cent of what we sell.”
Product timeline
Tenaris has developed its new steel grade through the time-tested process of working closely with the operators as production requirements evolve, identifying solution gaps and utilizing the steel manufacturer’s robust engineering and technical resources and personnel to fill those gaps, said Clark.
“From those gaps, we propose and work with the R&D groups in other countries — our metallurgy department, our engineering and the technical sales — to see if there’s something we can do to adapt something we currently have, or to re-engineer something completely.
“If there is something and we see demand for it, which in this case is the growing area of the Montney, then that’s where we invest more time in developing and testing the product. It’s an iterative process. This is one of nine products we built specifically for Canada, and one of two that we’re releasing this year.”
So far, the TN 80EY product is qualified and tested, meeting all regulatory requirements, and the next step is to run the steel grade with a customer, she added.
“We’re manufacturing it at the beginning of 2022. We have customers who are very much looking forward to this, because it will impact their well costs considerably, and they achieve a better product than their options are today. We haven’t run it yet, but we expect to in Q1 2022.”

Tourmaline Hikes 2021 EP Capital Spending Program | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Tourmaline Oil Corp.’s 2021 EP capital program has been increased to $1.375 billion with the 2H 2021 increase focused on liquids business/production increases and related liquids margin improvements, and the modest acceleration of drilling activities. 
That’s up from the previous target of $1.27 billion.
Full-year 2021 average production is now expected to be 440,000-445,000 boe/d and increased full-year CF of $3.0 billion is now anticipated along with $1.6 billion of FCF. The majority of the incremental facility capital is being expended in Q3, yielding estimated capital spending of $420 million in Q3 and $350 million in Q4. The updated 2H 2021/2022 EP capital program is consistent with previous guidance.
Material reduction in drilling times throughout 2021, particularly in NEBC, will result in completion of the originally planned full-year 2021 drilling program by November.  B.C. Montney per-well drilling times have been reduced by approximately 20 per cent in 2021 (two days less per well).  As a result, the company has elected to accelerate the drilling of approximately 21 wells from 2022 into Q4 2021 in order to maintain the existing top-tier, company operated drilling fleet at full capacity, rather than release rigs at this time.  The majority of these incremental wells will not be completed and brought on production until 2022.
The company will monitor natural gas supply/demand balances and schedule new production startups appropriately through the course of winter and the balance of 2022.  Tourmaline has incremental egress on the GTN system of 100 mmcf/d in 2022 and a further 50 mmcf/d in 2023, as well as 140 mmcf/d of egress to the Gulf Coast accessing international LNG commencing in 2023. 
Total volumes on the GTN system will grow from 330 mmcf/d currently to 480 mmcf/d by 2H 2023, with over 80 per cent of these volumes accessing the California market.  Incremental company gas volumes in 2022/2023 will not be directed at AECO or Station 2.
Acceleration of both the Gundy Phase 2 and Nig Creek deep cut installations/expansions will add approximately 15,000 bbls/d of condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (including 5,000 bbls/d of propane) by exit 2021/Q1 2022. 
Liquids margins will also be improved through utilization of company operated facilities rather than third party processing options.  Margin improvement will also be realized through an increase in RIPET propane exports.  2022 average annual liquids production of approximately 115,000 bbls/d is now expected, up 2,000 bbls/d from previous estimates.  Edmonton propane and butane prices are up over 200 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, over the past 12 months.
The recently approved 2022 EP capital budget of $1.125 billion is expected to deliver average production of 500,000-510,000 boe/d, $3.7 billion of cash flow and $2.5 billion of FCF on strip pricing. The 2022 EP capital budget, essentially a maintenance program, is $62 million less than previous estimates given specific facility projects and select drilling accelerated into 2H 2021.
 Production, CF, and FCF are all higher than previous 2022 guidance.  The company expects capital efficiencies to improve further in 2022 as a significant portion of the planned 2022 facility expenditures have been accelerated into 2H 2021.
2021 free cash flow allocation to date
FCF in 2021 to date has been consistently directed towards modest, sustainable base dividend increases and continued net debt reduction until the long-term net debt target of $1.0 to $1.2 billion is achieved.
The base dividend has now been increased twice in 2021; in aggregate a 21 per cent increase over the Q4 2020 dividend level.  The net debt target is now anticipated to be achieved during Q4 2021.
Free cash flow allocation strategy
Tourmaline intends to return the vast majority of FCF to shareholders on a go-forward basis.
This FCF return will be achieved through modest, sustainable base dividend increases, special dividends when appropriate, and tactical share buybacks.
Given stronger than anticipated 2021 commodity prices and production volumes, and early achievement of the long-term net debt target, Tourmaline is in a position to increase its base quarterly dividend by $0.01/share to $0.18/share payable on Dec. 31, 2021, which represents an annualized payout of $0.72/share as well as declare a special cash dividend of $0.75/share, payable on Oct. 7, 2021, to shareholders of record on Oct. 1, 2021 with an ex-dividend date of Sept. 2021. 
Given the observance of Canada's new statutory holiday on Sept. 30, this day will be considered a non-settlement day and as such the TSX requires the ex-dividend date on dividends with an Oct. 1, 2021 record date to be Sept. 29, 2021.  This special cash dividend is designated as an ""eligible dividend"" for Canadian income tax purposes.
Based on current strip pricing, the company will be in a position to continue to distribute special dividends, the size of which will depend upon the magnitude of excess FCF generated by elevated commodity prices in 2022 and beyond, and the relative return offered by other FCF allocation opportunities.
On current strip, 2022 FCF is estimated to be $2.5 billion which represents over $7.50/diluted share and a 19 per cent free cash yield based on a $40 share price.
FCF above the required maintenance capital and the long term three-five pre cent per annum growth embedded in the five-year EP program may also be allocated to modest asset acquisitions in existing core complexes and continued capital investments in liquids midstream opportunities.
The company expects annual expenditures of up to $250 million for these 'bolt-on' style asset acquisitions and land sales, generally proximal to existing Tourmaline operated infrastructure.  Future acquisitions will have similar FCF accretion metrics to the successful 2019-2021 acquisition program already completed.  In Q3 2021, the Company closed one $9.0 million asset acquisition in the Peace River High complex (449 boe/d, 5.4 million boe 2P reserves, 12 gross (10.1 net) tier 1 Charlie Lake oil locations, associated minor facilities, based on internal estimates).
Liquids midstream expenditures are expected to continue over the next several years and the Company is evaluating a series of opportunities within existing core complexes.  These are high return projects.  The Nig Creek deep cut installation provides an estimated return of over 100 per cent over the next four years.  The company intends to grow the corporate liquids midstream business segment and views these investments as a profitable allocation option for growing future FCF.
The company expects exit 2021 net debt of approximately $960 million, after giving effect to the Q4 2021 special dividend.  The company intends to keep long term net debt in the $1.0-$1.2 billion range.
500,000 boe/d 2021 exit
The company expects to achieve the 500,000 boe/d average production milestone by exit 2021, earlier than originally anticipated.  The accelerated timing is driven by the impact of improved drilling efficiencies and acceleration of the aforementioned liquids midstream projects.
Tourmaline estimates annual maintenance EP capital of $1.0-$1.05 billion to maintain average production at the 500,000 boe/d level.
Share buybacks
Tourmaline renewed its NCIB effective July 20, 2021 and plans to utilize buybacks under the NCIB to complement the return to shareholders.
The board has also approved the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in common shares over the next two years through issuer bids, contingent upon share price performance, and subject to the terms of the issuer bid and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, including the TSX.

"For Peyto, The Cardium Has Been Big Part Of Its Past, Front And Centre In Its Future | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
This is part 3 in our three-part Cardium series this week. For the other stories, click on the links below: 
Obsidian Continues To Be All-In On The Cardium
Cardium Activity Continues At A Modest Pace Compared To Other Plays, But Still Has Lots To Give

The Cardium play in west-central Alberta is very much a part of Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.’s corporate DNA and continues to play a prominent role in the company’s operational focus and efforts going forward.
Targeting natural gas and liquids-rich assets in the Greater Sundance area of the Cardium, Peyto, since its inception in 1998, has long been enamored with the play as it was the first asset the company pursued and built upon, explains president and CEO Darren Gee.
“We’ve been a player in the Cardium for a long time — Peyto really began in the Cardium. It was the play that we started the company on,” he said.
“We saw obviously that there was a large resource of gas there that could be developed at reasonable gas prices. But at the time, back in the late ‘90s, obviously there was no horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracking technology so we drilled vertical wells.
As such, pre-2009 the company developed the play with vertical wells sometimes commingling with other cretaceous zones. Peyto drilled over 400 such wells.
“We delineated a lot of the Cardium and logged it so we had a very good understanding of the geology and the idiosyncrasies of a big resource play. And then along came this horizontal technology. Now, all of a sudden, we can open a whole lot more rock,” Gee said.
While early horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracking results were promising, Peyto opted to take a slow but steady approach in its use of the emerging technologies.
“The shale guys went at it quite aggressively. They went for extremely long horizontals and they went for as tight frack spacing along those horizontals as they could with as much sand and water as they could pump to try to smash open a lot of source rock to get productivity out,” Gee said.
“For us, working with real reservoirs, we’ve gone at it a lot slower, I would say. The initial vertical wells in the Cardium were commercial and the initial venture into the horizontal wells was commercial. So it’s not like we had to go to the ends of the earth with the technology and size of stimulations to get commerciality,” he added.
“We started to use the technology but probably in a lesser way. We were always a little more reluctant to pump more cost into the ground not knowing we were going to get more result back. So we’ve really been slow, I would say, over the last decade to tweak the design and push longer with horizontal drilling to introduce more jewelry into the hole — more frack stages.”
From 2009 to 2014, Peyto drilled 47 horizontals in the Cardium. The relatively high drill and complete (D&C) capital costs were offset by strong oil prices and the play was economic. In 2015-2016 oil prices collapsed and the company paused drilling in the Cardium to focus on drier gas assets.
From 2017 and beyond, lower capital costs on the company’s new well design has allowed Peyto to drill 125 (and counting) horizontals in the Cardium in the last five years and the recent strength in oil prices have further bolstered the economics of the play.
“We’ve been slowly pushing out longer horizontals and slowly taking a little more risk on the horizontal drilling. And we’re learning more, too. That’s not to say horizontal technology hasn’t continued to develop. Over the last decade horizontal drilling has really advanced a lot with muds and bit selection and directional drilling and some of the technologies that are being used today,” Gee said.
“So we’ve been taking advantage of that learning all the way along. So when you look at the design of the horizontals from day one to today, it looks like a big step change. But it really has been small steps along the way over the last decade.”
Today’s Cardium well design
J.P. Lachance, chief operating officer, said the company’s current Cardium well design at Greater Sundance has upped productivity and reduced D&C costs by some 47 per cent.
“I think that what you see … in our Greater Sundance area is the change in the pre-2018 design was really taking our vertical design and turning it sideways. We were fracking pretty much the same way. I think what we realized was when prices got poorer and the economics and that cost structure went up, it wasn’t able to give us the economic returns so we needed to change something,” he said.
“So we went to a different fluid system with water, which was obviously cheaper to run than say a gel system or a cross-leg system. So when we made that change we also made a change in the way we were deploying sand. So we chopped it up into smaller bits with less sand per stage,” Lachance added.
“We have increased our lengths a little bit but you can see the dramatic change for the cost structure and it improved results at the same time.”
Lachance added that the ball-drop technology that the company prefers to utilize in its fracking efforts also needed to be fine-tuned.
“The technology really did need to evolve on the ball-drop system that we like to employ to be able to put in the number of stages that we’re doing today. It really did need to evolve. So that was part of it, too,” he said.
Lachance said that later this year Peyto plans to extend the length of its Cardium wells “a little bit.”
“We have had great success in our other play extending the lengths. We have to be careful because we actually do a lot more stages per length in the Cardium than we do in the other species that we drill,” he said.
“So we don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We also want to make sure we can execute them. But that is something we can do that will definitely have some value enhancements.”
Gee noted that some of the changes were “born out of necessity” due to the lower gas prices at the time.
“We had to try something a bit different to make commerciality. Now we’ve got a higher gas price, but having now proven that what we tried differently is working better, we’ve taken that adoption forward and are enjoying the increase in profitability as a result,” he said.
The CEO admits that the company was sometimes criticized by analysts and investors for its slow adoption of horizontal drilling-multi-stage fracking in the Cardium. But, he said, the slow-paced rollout is in keeping with Peyto’s “risk adverse” tendencies.
“I think the criticism of Peyto would be that, ‘You guys were really slow to adopt what some others were doing out of necessity.’ But part of that, again, goes back to the fact that we were making commercial results with the older technology because of our low cost structure and our superior execution. We didn’t have to change and we were waiting to see that the change would be a positive one for sure and with low risk,” he said.
“So we’re very risk adverse at Peyto. It’s part of the reason that we started in the Deep Basin with the great big resource plays to begin with — because we didn’t like geological risk. We wanted to make sure that what we were drilling was there for sure and that we were going to be able to get commercial results out of it,” Gee added.
“The same kind of logic applies with the adoption of this latest well design. Again, we’re risk adverse so we’re adopting it slowly.”
Improving economics, long-term productivity
Gee said that with strong commodity prices and the company’s evolving well design Cardium wells in the Greater Sundance area now pay out in about eight months, as opposed to the pre-2018 wells that paid out on average in 3.6 years.
“That really is huge because if you think about financially the amount of leverage you had to carry to have project pay out in three-and-a-half years, yeah there might be a nice return there — even a 20 per cent rate-of-return. And you would say that’s positive and good enough to justify the investment,” he said.
“But you’ve got to have a lot of leverage and the ability to carry that capital for three-and-a-half years until you got it paid out. Whereas now, if we’re paying out inside a year we don’t really need any leverage.”
Gee said an additional benefit of the company’s Greater Sundance program is the NGLs produced have a “heavy blend” of condensate and C5 that receive light oil pricing, as opposed to less economically enticing liquids like butane, propane and ethane.
“The Cardiums have a lot more condensate and C5 than the other zones that we develop. And that really does enhance the economics a lot, of course,” he said.
According to Lachance, the company’s Cardium wells on average produce about 60 bbls of NGLs per mmcf with about 40 bbls of that being C5-plus and condensates.
Gee said the company’s Cardium wells offer both short- and long-term productivity, but it’s the long-life of the wells that is key for Peyto.
“Productivity initially is important and the productivity over the life of the well is important. But there’s only so much you can do. Sometimes you can spend a lot of money to enhance the initial productivity but it doesn’t last very long. But you have to get then long-term productivity,” he said.
“And that’s the one great thing about this being a conventional reservoir, a tight sandstone reservoir, is that we have evidence that there is long-term recovery. We have all these old vertical wells that have been around forever. There’s a bunch of Cardium vertical wells that have been on for 50 years or more and they’re still producing today in the Deep Basin,” Gee added.
“We have that evidence of longevity. So we know these horizontal wells are going to last that long, as well. Really, it boils down to can we get that right combination of capital investment, recovery and economic profitability. That’s what we’re always striving for.”
Cardium activity outlook
Lachance said Peyto drilled about 17 wells in the first half of this year and is looking to drill another 15 or so to year-end.
“So we’ll have around 30 or 35 by the end of the year, I would expect. Last year we drilled 30. So a little more than last year,” he said.
Gee said the company will spend between $315-$320 million this year on organic development activities across its portfolio, with about one-third of that capital outlay directed at the Cardium. And next year’s activity and spending in the play is expected to be at similar levels.
“It will probably be about the same. We’re pretty steady developing our Cardium. We have quite a bit on inventory. In our Cardium we’ve probably got well over 400 undeveloped locations booked and that’s over a decade of drilling and we’ve got another 400 locations beyond that identified,” he said.
“So we’ve got a couple of decades, really, of Cardium drilling at this pace.”

"Asia LNG Price Soars On China Power Crunch, European Demand | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Asia LNG prices soared this week, as the world's top buyer China faced an ongoing power crunch and low inventory in Europe drove up competition for the super-chilled fuel.
The average LNG price for November delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at about $37/mmBtu, up nearly 16 per cent from the previous week, industry sources said.
December delivery prices were estimated to be about $38/mmBtu, they added.
Price agency S&P Global Platts's Japan-Korea-Marker (JKM), which is widely used as a benchmark in the spot market, had surged to a record high of $56.326/mmBtu on Wednesday, before easing later in the week.
""The market is still very bullish for winter and any piece of headline is driving up sentiment,"" a Singapore-based trader said.
Gazprom's China-focused Amur gas processing plant in Russia's Far East has halted operations after a fire early on Friday, a spokesman for the plant told Reuters.
The broader implications were not immediately clear, but the plant plays an important part in Russian gas exports to China, which has been hit by electricity shortages that have led to power rationing across the country.
Bangladesh bought on LNG cargo from Vitol for delivery in mid-October at $35.89/mmBtu and another from Gunvor for late October delivery at $36.95/mmBtu, which are the highest prices paid by the country for spot cargoes, an official of state-run Petrobangla said.
Freight rates to ship LNG rose this week and are at multi-month highs as the increase in LNG demand has driven up the need for vessels to move supplies, sources said.
Production issues at Sakhalin and Indonesia are also supporting prices, a Singapore-based source said.
Pakistan may consider only relying on term supplies should current spot prices remain elevated, an industry source said.

"China Digs In On Coal, Oil Gains As Energy Crisis Deepens | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — China ordered miners in Inner Mongolia to ramp up coal production and oil prices jumped on Friday.
The rebound in economic activity from coronavirus restrictions has exposed alarmingly low supplies of natural gas leaving traders, industry executives and governments scrambling as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.
The energy crisis, which has led to fuel shortages and blackouts in some countries, has highlighted the difficulty in cutting the global economy's dependency on fossil fuels as world leaders seek to revive efforts to tackle climate change at talks next month in Glasgow.
In China, where coal production had been curtailed to meet climate goals, officials have ordered more than 70 coal mines in Inner Mongolia to ramp up production by nearly 100 million tonnes or 10 per cent, as the world's largest exporter battles its worst power shortages in years.
Russia's Gazprom, a key supplier of gas to China, calmed fears that a fire at a major gas processing plant could worsen the situation, saying it was able to continue exporting gas to China as normal.
India, the second largest coal consumer after China, is also suffering electricity outages because of a lack of coal with over half of its coal-fired power plants having less than three days’ worth of fuel stocks, data from the federal grid operator showed.
Oil prices rose on Friday, on track for gains of nearly five per cent this week, as industries switch fuel. ""A lot of catalysts are out there to keep the oil market tight,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.
Reflecting the gravity of the situation, the United States has not ruled out tapping into its strategic petroleum reserves, which it typically only does after major supply disruptions such as hurricanes, or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil, though there are doubts it is ready to take such action yet.
""DOE is actively monitoring global energy market supply and will work with our agency partners to determine if and when actions are needed,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Energy said.
Stoking tensions
Global fuel shortages are another blow to a world economy just getting back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic and threaten an expensive winter for consumers.
China is going to allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20 per cent from base levels, instead of 10-15 per cent previously, in order to prevent high energy consumption, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday, citing a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, bought two cargoes of LNG for delivery in October at record prices, two industry sources said on Friday, as low stocks in Europe boosts competition with Asia for supplies.
""It is really tough to cope with such abnormal prices. At the moment, we have no other option but to buy to keep economic activities going,"" an official of state-run Petrobangla, which oversees LNG supplies, said.  
Bangladesh is reviewing leases of five oil-fired power plants which are nearing expiry, despite its plan to move from oil towards natural gas for power generation.
Even before the current energy crisis erupted, the world was far behind on efforts to avert catastrophic climate change with a United Nations analysis estimating that global emissions would be 16 per cent higher in 2030 than they were in 2010 based on countries' current pledges.
Surging energy prices are stoking tensions in Europe over the green transition. Wealthier nations want to keep up the pressure to quit fossil fuels while poorer ones, worried about the cost to the consumer, are wary.
Britain's energy regulator warned that energy bills, which have just been hiked, are likely to rise significantly in April due to high wholesale costs which have forced some suppliers out of business.
Divisions within the European Union have deepened, with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban blaming European Union action to combat climate change for the current crisis and saying Poland and Hungary would present a united front at the next EU summit.
Analysts have said rising gas prices are the main driver of European electricity costs, while the soaring cost of permits on the EU carbon market has contributed around a fifth of the power price increase.

September Licence Count Rises Despite No New Permits In B.C. | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Operators across Canada licensed 543 new wells in September — the highest monthly tally for 2021 — although no new wells were licensed in British Columbia.
As in August, B.C. approved no new wells in September (down from 38 a year ago), as the province continues to work with the Blueberry River First Nations (BRFN) on a way to improve and modernize provincial processes that recognize and respect their treaty rights.
Last week, Blueberry River and the B.C. government reached an initial agreement. The province and BRFN are now working to finalize an interim approach for reviewing new natural resource activities that balance Treaty 8 rights, the economy and the environment.
Once an interim approach is in place, the negotiation teams will work to reach long-term solutions that protect Treaty 8 rights and an Indigenous way of life. They will explore establishing areas for protection and developing ecosystem-based management systems to incorporate cumulative impacts into decision-making.
September licence counts
Last month’s licence count was up 93 per cent from 281 in September 2020.
Alberta licensed 409 wells last month, an increase from 156 wells in the year-prior period, while Saskatchewan permitted 121 new wells compared to 83 in September 2020.
Manitoba’s permit count rose to 12 from last year’s four.
Canadian Natural Resources Limited was the top licensee in September with 88 permits, followed by Cenovus Energy Inc. (71), Suncor Energy Inc. (44), Ovintiv Canada ULC (29) and Headwater Exploration Inc. (28).
Nine month tallies
Governments across Canada licensed 3,647 new wells in the first nine months of 2021, up 46 per cent from 2,506 permits granted in January-September 2020.
In Alberta, the nine-month tally is up 84 per cent to 2,229 well authorizations compared to 1,212 in the year-prior period.
In Saskatchewan, a total of 967 wells were licensed to the end of September, up 20 per cent from 809 in the first nine months a year ago.
British Columbia has approved 321 permits in January-September 2021 compared to 422 at the nine-month mark a year ago (down 24 per cent).
The licence count in Manitoba to the end of September is up 144 per cent to 122 from 50 a year ago.
Including experiment wells, the top five companies that licensed wells during the first three-quarters of 2021 were: Canadian Natural (232 permits), Cenovus (228), Tourmaline Oil Corp. (167), Crescent Point Energy Corp. (164) and Teine Energy Ltd. (143).

Over the first nine months of this year, oil well permits across Western Canada have increased to 2,295 from 1,372 a year ago (up 67 per cent), while the tally for gas well authorizations to the end of September is 928 versus 842 in the comparable period in 2020 (up 10 per cent).
To the end of September, operators have licensed 3,233 horizontal wells, or about 89 per cent of the total wells authorized across Canada (excluding experimental wells). A year ago, there were 2,120 horizontal wells licensed to the end of September (87 per cent of the total wells authorized, excluding experimental wells).
There were no oilsands evaluation wells licensed in September, down from 27 last year. Year-to-date, only six oilsands evaluation wells have been licensed compared to 64 in January-September 2020.

Blueberry’s Broad Implications: Webinar Considers Recent Landmark B.C. Court Decision | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Governments across Western Canada must consider the broad implications of the recent decision concerning the Blueberry River First Nations and approvals for forestry and resource development, and also think about other situations where Indigenous ways of life have been limited by using land for agriculture and other purposes.
That advice was provided by University of Saskatchewan College of Law professor Dwight Newman during a University of Calgary School of Public Policy webinar this week on Indigenous rights and resource development.
“These are big questions for governments to be engaged with there, and for governments and First Nations to be talking about,” said Newman, who is USask’s Canada Research Chair for Indigenous rights in constitutional and international law.
He added the court’s decision has implications beyond Treaty 8, and the trial judge’s decision shows the treaty protects not just a set of discrete, stereotypical activities, but a way of life.
Earlier this year, the B.C. Supreme Court found the B.C. government breached the Treaty 8 agreement signed with the nation more than 120 years ago because it allowed development such as forestry and natural gas extraction without the community’s approval. The court found that the province failed its treaty promise to maintain the nation’s rights to hunt, fish and trap without interference.
“I think that this is [a case] where the Blueberry Nation has stood up against government paternalism, and the paternalism of others who would confine them to specific categories, and has had a judge recognize that they’re in a treaty relationship that protects their way of life,” Newman said.
In consideration of the court’s June 29 decision in favour of Blueberry River, the B.C. Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation cancelled pending petroleum and natural gas tenure dispositions, with the province considering the cumulative impacts in its approach to resource development project decision-making.
New well licensing activity was also halted.
On Oct. 6, the First Nation and the B.C. government announced they had reached an initial agreement, which allows 195 forestry and oil and gas projects, permitted or authorized prior to the court decision and where activities have not yet started, to proceed.
However, 20 currently-approved authorizations that are related to development activities in highly culturally-important areas will not proceed without further negotiation and agreement from Blueberry.
As for the court decision, Newman said, much of what the trial judge did with this case in general was engaged with the process around Treaty 8. “Historical evidence that’s referenced there isn’t about the specific adhesion of the Blueberry River First Nations, but is about Treaty 8 generally.”
Regarding questions around the applications to other numbered treaties, he added, the argument that other treaties might also want to protect ways of life, rather than lists of specific activities, has a lot of potential for carrying over into other contexts, depending on the record in a particular treaty case.
“In terms of non-treaty contexts, in one way, jurisprudence about the treaty context doesn’t translate over easily, and in other ways it does, because at some point, something like the idea that there’s a protection for Indigenous ways of life, rather than just discrete activities, needs to be the way we start thinking about things more fully.”
In a sense, Newman said, “one almost wishes” that the B.C. government had appealed the landmark court decision in favour of Blueberry River, only because it could have seen this important decision reaffirmed at a higher level up the court chain.
“Although they managed to do it really quickly, it’s still 60 trial days — that’s a lot of money spent on lawyers and other experts that has gone into this case,” he told the webinar. “To have that kind of record to inform appellate decisions would have been really helpful in some respects in terms of getting an appellate-level statement of accumulative impacts.”
He added: “I just hope [that this case] will continue to inform scholarship and other cases in a way so that it’s not lost to a trial-level decision in terms of the impact on the law. I think we need to keep talking about the decision, its significance, and [we need to] make sure other courts do pay attention to it in other situations where this arises.”
Supporting IBAs
Sandy Carpenter, co-founder, Canadian Regulatory and Indigenous Law, told this week’s webinar that while governments, due to paternalism, ignorance or politics, feel consultation with Indigenous communities is important if development has perceived negative impacts, the same is not necessarily the case if the impacts would be positive.
“I worry that politics interferes with this,” he said, citing the recent experiences of Central Alberta’s Ermineskin Cree Nation. “We get to make a designation decision against a proposed coal development, because that looks good on our political record, and we won’t talk to First Nations who might be in favour of something.”
On July 19 of this year, the Federal Court quashed an Environment and Climate Change ministerial designation order from June 2020 subjecting Coalspur Mines Ltd.’s Vista mine expansion project to federal impact assessment agency review. The courts found the minister had failed to consult the Ermineskin Cree Nation, which has an impact benefit agreement (IBA) with Coalspur.
“For me, this decision was incredible, because for the first time in my life I heard that my economic opportunities are connected to Section 35 rights protected under Canada’s constitution,” said Carol Wildcat, consultation director, Ermineskin Cree Nation. “But yet, a minister and some courts have decided they don’t need to consult with us.”
She added: “Consultation is a very important part of my development and my people’s developments. Mitigation, accommodation and compensation — I’m a big fan of those. Always have been.”

Navigating Net Zero: JWN Energy To Launch COP26 Series Next Week | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
COP26 will be as much about the words as it will be about the numbers.
As the world’s attention turns to Glasgow at the end of this month and into November for the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, and the 26th annual meeting since the signing of the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, it is difficult to predict what will emerge at the conference’s close.
One key goal is for delegates to put the finishing touches on the Paris Rulebook, first advanced in 2015. But given the momentum the climate debate has gained in recent months, COP26 is expected to produce new and renewed commitments to collective action. Still, it’s safe to say there will be much debate and discussion to weigh and ponder — and many numbers to find the right context in which to contemplate them — as representatives from nearly 200 countries seek consensus on that collective action.
Canada is not the world’s largest emitter, of course, but it’s among the handful of developed countries whose emissions are still growing. And given that reality, there’s a heavier burden on Canada to demonstrate a commitment to action perhaps more than most.
For Canadians in general, and Albertans in particular, COP26 presents an opportunity to ground Canada’s climate efforts in a global context. It’s an opportunity to think critically about choices the country needs to make in the swirling complexities of what we now know as a Net Zero world. It’s a chance to make sense of the headlines and broadcasts about climate considerations that are now a daily staple of our lives. 
Net Zero is a term burdened with tremendous responsibilities — but also tremendous opportunities. Net Zero is about critical choices Canadians will make. It will influence how we vote and how we invest. It will impact the taxes we pay. It will crystalize our sense of environmental responsibility. It will shape our global perspectives as it cracks open the sad realities of energy poverty and energy entitlement. It will mold our thinking generationally.
COP26 is an opportunity to put Net Zero into thoughtful context — and navigationally map out strategic pathways forward.
It can be challenging to sort the climate wheat from the climate chaff — to understand what is true and valid and distinguish it from the politicized and radicalized hyperbole at the fringe. To help Canadians keen to understand what is a highly nuanced issue, we asked nine individuals to share their thoughts in the days leading up to COP26. Their perspectives will be presented via our Navigating Net Zero platform — a thought leadership framework created at JWN Energy to curate content related to Canadian efforts on the climate file.

The authors were selected because they each offer a different view of how to contemplate climate — and understand the climate pathways down which Canada and Alberta are already journeying. They represent the policy and innovation ecosystems, as well as the corporate and Indigenous sectors.
Our “perspectives panel” includes:

Marla Orenstein, director, Natural Resources Centre, and Janet Lane, director, Human Capital Centre, Canada West Foundation
Jeanette Jackson, chief executive officer, Foresight
Jim Boucher, chair and president, Saa Dene Group
Laura Kilcrease, chief executive officer, Alberta Innovates
Michael Binnion, chief executive officer, Questerre Energy Corporation and Modern Miracle Network
Steve MacDonald, chief executive officer, Emissions Reduction Alberta
Brad Hayes, director, Canadian Society for Unconventional Resources
Martha Hall Findlay, chief sustainability officer, Suncor Energy Inc.

“Net Zero” is also tied directly to the concept of energy transition — another term that bears much responsibility. Like Net Zero, energy transition is “social shorthand” that is now part of our lives in ways we are only beginning to discern. Like Net Zero, “energy transition” has the potential to be both unifying and divisive as Canadians face a range of increasingly difficult choices about energy and the climate.
Through JWN’s Navigating Net Zero platform, our goal is to convene conversations that are balanced and constructive — creating a space that responsibly advances the dialogues central to climate considerations as Canada explores its pathways and possibilities.

U.S. Drillers Add Oil And Gas Rigs For Sixth Week In A Row – Baker Hughes | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a sixth week in a row as oil prices soared to their highest since 2014, prompting drillers to return to the wellpad.
The oil and gas rig count rose 10 to 543 in the week to Oct. 15, its highest since April 2020, said Baker Hughes.
That puts the total rig count up 261 rigs, or 93 per cent, over this time last year.
U.S. oil rigs rose 12 to 445 this week, their highest since April 2020, while gas rigs fell one to 98, their lowest since August. The increase in oil rigs was the biggest weekly build since April 2021.
With oil prices up about 69 per cent so far this year, some energy firms said they plan to boost spending in 2021 after cutting drilling and completion expenditures in 2019 and 2020.
That spending increase, however, remains small as most firms continue to focus on boosting cash flow, reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns rather than adding output.

Shell Names Sawan As Head Of Gas And Renewables | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Royal Dutch Shell plc has appointed Wael Sawan as head of its integrated gas and renewables division, replacing Maarten Wetselaar who will leave the energy company after 25 years.
Sawan currently heads Shell’s oil and gas production, or upstream, division. In his new position he will oversee Shell’s continued expansion into low-carbon and renewable energies as well as the power markets, key pillars in Shell’s strategy to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050.
Sawan, 47, a Canadian citizen, is seen by many as a potential successor to chief executive Ben van Beurden along with Huibert Vigeveno, who heads Shell’s refining and chemicals division.
Sawan will be replaced by Zoë Yujnovich, 46, who currently heads conventional oil and gas operations, Shell said in a statement.
Both appointments are effective Oct. 25.
Wetselaar, once himself seen as a candidate to take the top spot in the company, will become the chief executive of Spanish oil company Cepsa starting Jan. 1, 2022, Shell said.
Wetselaar oversaw in recent years Shell’s growth into LNG and low-carbon, including investments in offshore wind, hydrogen and electric vehicle charging.
“I am also immensely grateful to Maarten for his outstanding contribution to Shell and our customers, for his vision and drive in shaping a world-class LNG portfolio, and for laying the foundations of our power and renewable solutions business,” CEO van Beurden said in a statement.
Cepsa chairman Ahmad Yahia Al Idrissi said in a statement that Wetselaar’s appointment would help Cepsa speed up its energy transition strategy.
Cepsa, owned by Mubadala and Carlyle, has started making forays into renewable energy including signing a joint venture with Masdar to develop wind and solar projects in Spain and Portugal, and has built a 28.8 megawatt wind farm in southern Spain.

Global Entrants Competing For XPRIZE Selected For Avatar Carbon Removal Accelerator | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
In August, the XPRIZE Foundation, Avatar Innovations Inc. and the University of Calgary launched a tailor-made accelerator for companies and technologies in the Musk Foundation-funded carbon removal competition. On Thursday, the partnership selected the final 10 entrants into this Avatar Carbon Removal Accelerator.
Representing four countries — Canada, the U.S., Germany, and Singapore — the finalists will undergo a Calgary-based process to support their entries into the $100 million Carbon Removal XPRIZE.
“These 10 global carbon removal companies hold the potential to both win the XPRIZE and shape and make this emerging global market,” said Kevin Krausert, president and chief executive officer of Avatar Innovations. He noted that carbon removal technologies can help reverse the worst effects of climate change. “Canada’s energy sector is once again leading the country towards our shared climate ambitions with real technology and real solutions.”
According to Marcius Extavour, vice-president of climate and energy for XPRIZE, immediate, deep emissions cuts working in parallel with new solutions are some of the “many things” needed to combat climate change, which involves creating an “entire ecosystem” of technologies and solutions working to rebalance the carbon cycle.
“The $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal was created to inspire and create real, tangible change in the climate math,” he suggested. “The Avatar Carbon Removal Accelerator is an incredible example of a community collaborating towards this common goal and driving innovation.”
Entrants selected
Selected from a list of 43 global applicants, following technical and commercial review, the accelerator’s Canadian entrants include AirTerra (for a co-composted biochar super-soil ingredient), as well as Blue Line Carbon Capture (for its cryogenic direct air capture solutions), CANTON (for carbon nanomaterials using a novel chemical looping process), and ZS2 Technologies (for magnesium carbon-based cement).
From the U.S., entrants include the Blue Carbon Factory (for a giant kelp afforestation carbon removal factory), Carbon Sirge (for a subsurface carbon biomass geo-engineering solution), Pure Catalysts (for its nano-catalyst for carbon removal reactions), and Undersert (for terraforming idle deserts into carbon sinks).
The German entrant is Hydrogenate (for its solid carbon with oxidation “state 0”), while the Singapore entrant is CauseAlgae (for carbon-negative biopolymers with engineered algae).
Industry on board
The rigorous accelerator program aims to provide finalists with a unique, technology-focused entrepreneurship curriculum and partnership opportunities and mentorship from some of the world’s leading energy companies — Cenovus Energy Inc., Enbridge Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, Shell Canada Limited, and Suncor Energy Inc.
Martha Hall-Findlay, chief sustainability officer at Suncor, said that by gathering some of the most promising climate technologies with financial and capital market expertise, Avatar’s accelerator “super charges” efforts to tackle climate challenges. “It will further position Canada as a leader in carbon research and solutions — Suncor is proud to be a partner is this effort.”
Presented by National Bank of Canada, the accelerator will integrate leading financial and capital market experts to support these firms while they undergo a 12-week technology curriculum designed by Andrew Maxwell, Bergeron chair in the Technology Entrepreneurship Lassonde School of Engineering at York University.
“This initiative is aligned with our commitment to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and playing an active role in the climate transition,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, head of Energy Investment Banking, National Bank Financial Inc. “We congratulate these 10 companies for having developed ground-breaking innovations that will have a positive impact on the future of our planet.”
UCalgary support
Bolstering the accelerator’s laboratory and research capabilities is UCalgary, which offers entrants unique access to researchers and investors, labs, expert advisement, and $1 billion worth of carbon technology testing facilities. The goal is supporting applicants in successfully developing scalable carbon removal technologies to meet XPRIZE criteria.
Further, UCalgary will connect the accepted accelerator parties into the same the successful carbon eco-system that generated successful finalists for the NRG COSIA XPRIZE.
“The Avatar Carbon Removal Accelerator is a unique example of private sector collaboration working to solve one of the world’s grand challenges — reducing carbon emissions to decrease the impact of climate change,” said Deborah Yedlin, who is CEO of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, as well as UCalgary’s chancellor.
She added: “We are very excited it has chosen to be in Calgary — because it will highlight the progress already being made by the energy sector and the University of Calgary.”

Nabors Fully Automated Land Rig Successfully Drills First Well | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Nabors Industries Ltd.’s  PACE-R801 has reached total depth on its first well, a horizontal well for Exxon Mobil Corporation in the Permian Basin.
Nabors says it’s the world's first fully automated land drilling rig.
Combining Nabors proprietary Smart Suite of automated drilling software with Canrig robotics on the PACE-R801 creates an unmanned rig floor that removes crews from red zone areas and delivers consistent, predictable drilling performance, said the company.
Similar to concept vehicles in the automobile industry, this particular configuration of PACE-R801 is built to showcase Nabors technology and push the boundaries of industry performance and possibilities. The featured automation, robotics and digitalization technologies are available and operational across the Nabors fleet, and those of third parties globally.
Insights gained from PACE-R801 have been and will continue to be used to innovate and advance the next generation of Nabors technologies which focus on safety, efficiency and the environment. For example, recently deployed technology for Nabors SmartDRILL and SmartSLIDE drilling automation software was developed through the PACE-R801 initiative.
Utilization of the full suite of Nabors drilling automation software — which includes SmartDRILL and SmartSLIDE — reduced drilling days for operators by four in the Permian and Williston Basins and has shown promise to reduce drilling emissions.
Crew size on the PACE-R801 is similar to other Nabors rigs but the duties change. One driller is required to supervise the operations of the rig while others continue to perform essential tasks, such as service, maintenance, inspections and rig moves.
“Importantly, no longer are crews in red zone areas,” said the company.
The advanced rig and technologies provide reskilling opportunities for Nabors employees and the broader industry workforce, said Nabors.
Partnering with ExxonMobil
XTO Energy, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, contracted PACE-R801 to drill three horizontal wells on a test pad in Midland County, Texas, as part of its own R&D efforts and commitment to safe, efficient and responsible operations.
This first well was drilled to a total measured depth of 19,917 feet. Consistent with the practices of drillers and operators on test pads, Nabors and ExxonMobil do not plan to publish performance data and results.
Jason Gahr, operations manager for unconventional drilling at ExxonMobil, said: ""ExxonMobil's collaboration with Nabors in deploying this automated rig in Midland demonstrates the ability to optimize drilling using the combined power of robotics, automation, computing, and data. This is a great example of enhancing the safety, efficiency and environmental performance of our operations through innovative technologies.""

"PTAC Launches Record New Projects, Focuses On Methane Mitigation In Turbulent Year | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
With the stakes higher than ever this year, Petroleum Technology Alliance Canada (PTAC) leaned into collaborative innovation and technology development over the past year, its 25th, facilitating 186 projects throughout a 15-month period.
PTAC worked with more than 250 industry experts from its diverse stakeholders and sustained its financial position with the highest project revenue since inception, it reported at its annual general meeting this week.
In fact, one of the most valuable lessons from 2020/2021 is that innovation alone is not enough to secure the future of the industry — collaborative innovation offers the greatest solution, said PTAC president Soheil Asgarpour.
“The past 18 months have been some of the most challenging in our history. This past year brought an ongoing pandemic, severe weather, volatile markets and increased pressure to [reduce the] environmental footprint of oil and gas. But this session also brought new projects, exciting events, innovative solutions, new technologies and significant growth opportunities,” Asgarpour told the virtual AGM.
Much of the Calgary-based organization’s recent work focused on reducing methane emissions, which remains one of its highest priorities, with an increased emphasis on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) capacity to reduce emissions at reasonable cost. “And this is because reducing methane emissions is the most cost effective and fastest way to create a new oil and gas brand, for consumers that demand cleaner fuel.
“In addition, it will help our Canadian SMEs and technology providers prosper and meet our long-term vision to develop methane mitigation technologies capable of reducing the oil and gas sector's methane emissions by 90 per cent [by 2030], at a negative cost, or less than $5 per CO2 equivalent,” Asgarpour said.
While new emissions reductions technologies have been developed, they often struggle to scale throughout the industry, particularly among SMEs with less financial capacity.
“Several years ago, we noticed that the small and medium sized enterprises were struggling to secure the funds … required to commercialize their technologies. So we ramped up our SME program and formed numerous consortia that are helping to bridge that gap.
“These included the 2017 launch of a program to accelerate lab and field testing of new methane mitigation technologies in collaboration with Alberta Innovates, NRCan [Natural Resources Canada], 14 producers and 16 universities who dedicated over a billion dollars [worth] of field testing facilities for doing so. We are now field and lab testing methane mitigation technologies for SMEs at zero cost to them.”
In addition, PTAC secured funds from over 400 producers and various funding agencies for its research and development projects.
“Those and many other PTAC projects have facilitated the development and commercialization of technologies with the collective capacity … to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sector by 35 per cent. And this is not just in Alberta or Canada; these technologies have a market for international use. Essentially what we are trying to do is closing the methane emissions target of 45 per cent [reduction] by 2025 through those technologies, and we are on track to actually complete that task of getting to 45 per cent through capacity of technologies by next year.”
The challenge now is to increase market uptake, he said. “So once again, PTAC is stepping in to help overcome this challenge. We recently launched two programs that pay up to 75 per cent of the cost of methane mitigation equipment and installation, encouraging producers to get firsthand experience with new technologies, so they will be more likely to invest in implementing these technologies in a massive way.”
At the same time, PTAC assisted companies looking to bring their methane detection and mitigation technologies to international markets. “In the coming year, PTAC will launch several new initiatives to increase international sales of Alberta and Canada's cleantech products and technologies,” said Asgarpour.
PTAC also overcame the challenge of distance and embraced connection via technology in the 18 months of off and on pandemic induced lockdowns, hosting 32 online events including forums, workshops and Technology Information Sessions to ensure stakeholders stayed on top of project results, new research and technology development progress.
In fact, in many ways this pivot to digital platforms fostered much more extensive collaboration, PTAC said. A record-breaking 587 registrants from 21 countries across six continents attended PTAC’s Methane Emissions Reduction Forum last November.
PTAC further expanded its international reach with the launch of a directory of more than 60 cleantech companies working to export their methane detection and mitigation technologies to other jurisdictions around the world.
Methane focus
PTAC continued to facilitate a variety of methane emissions reduction initiatives, including the Intelligent Methane Monitoring and Mitigation System project, an analytics platform that will help industry maximize methane emissions reductions, minimize costs and optimize regulatory instruments.
And the Systematic Third-party Validation of Environmental and Economic Performance of Methane Reduction Technologies project continued to help operators choose the best equipment while increasing market uptake of proven methane mitigation technologies.
The data provided by the Fugitive Emissions Management Program Effectiveness Assessment will help inform industry and regulatory decisions, said PTAC, and the two Alberta Methane Field Challenge field campaigns tested new technologies in real-world conditions across seasonal variations.
The Alberta Upstream Petroleum Research Fund (AUPRF) program also continued to focus on scientific studies to support methane-related regulatory development, facilitating 27 ongoing research projects while completing three world-class methane detection and quantification projects in 2020/2021.
The AUPRF program was awarded $2.4 million in TIER funding to continue developing solutions for methane detection, quantification and emissions reduction. The AUPRF program currently realizes cost savings of an estimated $93 million per year, with future value projected at $203 million per year.

Why Publicis Sapient Is Bringing Together The Best In The Energy Industry | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Global EnergyTech Awards 2021 will not only celebrate the energy industry by rewarding startups and innovators in the space, but will facilitate introductions between winners and leading organizations and hopefully spark some powerful partnerships. But what led the consultancy to create this initiative?
Awards that empower the future of energy for everyone
In June, Publicis Sapient launched this unique awards program — The Global EnergyTech Awards. The focus is on the transformation and development of technology within the energy sector with entries open to startups, small businesses, developers and engineers across the world. The timing is spot on — the industry is going through significant change and the transition to a carbon zero future is underway, so there’s a lot of focus and demand in this area. Energy companies will increasingly have to partner with innovators in order to scale-up the skills and technology required to reach both their own and global net zero goals.
As a recognized leader of new technologies, Publicis Sapient want to bring the best ideas and talent together, leading the charge in this shift to a cleaner, greener world.
Joe Tabita, Energy Leader for EMEA and APAC at Publicis Sapient says, “These are exciting times in EnergyTech. The energy transition is driving new customer behaviors and expectations. Competition has jumped across business and geographical boundaries. There’s a huge opportunity for digital to be a core ingredient as the industry transforms how it produces, stores, trades and delivers energy.”
The Global EnergyTech Awards aim to embrace this opportunity and encourage the sharing and implementation of new ideas and technologies that will indeed transform the industry in years to come. Entries are open until the end of September, when judges from both Publicis Sapient and leading energy companies will select a short list of potential winners to present their ideas live to the panel. Winners will be announced and awards presented during a dual London/Houston ceremony in November.
Years in the making
The company at the helm is a well-respected powerhouse. For 30 years Publicis Sapient has been leading the way in digital business transformation within many industries, including energy. The consultancy is growing fast despite the economic downturn of 2020, with 53 offices across the globe from Calgary to London to Dubai. They’ve helped, and continue to help, some of the biggest names in the energy sector to make step changes towards a digital-first model as they move resources across the supply chain — all the way from generation, production and distribution to trading, supply and retail.
Publicis Sapient were originally known for energy and commodities trading. This is where the consultancy started out, disrupting a traditional industry with digital transformation and bringing it into the digital age by offering more choice when it comes to E/CTRM. This expertise is recognized in the Awards with a category dedicated to ‘Best Solution in Energy Trading’, which will hopefully shine light on new ways of working.
Now — and increasingly as we emerge from this crisis — identifying the most effective ways to reduce costs, improve operations and move faster to capture new opportunities will decide the future of energy trading organizations. Energy and commodities trading groups will therefore want to address customers and opportunities that have gained in strategic value as a result of these crises, and to leave markets that have been undermined by it. If they are to succeed, they have no choice but to transform themselves. Perhaps using the technology from winners of the Global EnergyTech Awards. The relatively slow progress of digital business transformation in this sector means that a major opportunity remains in play: removing low-value processes, which frees up the organization’s money and talent to focus on areas with the greatest potential for value creation. This allows more of the organization’s intellectual firepower to be used for activities where it can achieve a competitive edge. Too much of the upside of digitalization remains untapped. There is too little automation, too many data silos, too many in-house data centers and too many off-the-shelf IT packages with overlapping functionalities, and not enough consistency of process and technology across participants in the market.
Shaping the future of utilities
Another focus for Publicis Sapient’s energy team is digital utilities where the disruption of the energy market is in full swing. Today’s energy customer demands choice, affordability and trust. They expect providers to understand what they need. As some of the more established providers lag behind, more agile, digitally-driven players are emerging to turn up the heat and hopefully some will be entering the Global EnergyTech Awards to showcase their innovations.
The work of Publicis Sapient ensures that new or existing services are modernized in ways that enrich the life of the business or the end consumer, whether that’s more efficient business processes or smarter interfaces to warm the home.
Publicis Sapient are big enough to lead, but small enough to empathize, which is proved by the creation of the Global EnergyTech Awards — an exciting initiative that will bridge the gap between major energy organizations and the startups that will shape the industry of tomorrow. When the results are announced in November, there will be a curated list of the very best new minds in energy and we can’t wait to see it.

"Next Evolution Of Sanjel Spacer Line Targets Long, Complex Horizontal Wells | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
A spacer technology said to provide significant time savings for drilling operations has taken a major step forward.
This past June, Sanjel Energy Services was granted patents for its VISWEEP DM (dry mix) IS (invert systems). The spacer system that creates efficiencies through its mix-on-the-fly approach was developed at Sanjel Energy’s technical centre.
“The VISWEEP DM IS spacer system is the next evolution in our spacer family and another excellent example of our commitment to providing our clients with a broad range of innovative solutions,” said Murray Bickley, president and CEO of Sanjel Energy.
Spacer is a fluid that functions as a buffer between well fluids and cement slurry. This helps displace drilling fluid and gets the walls of the wellbore conditioned for cement bonding.


The photos above show the before and after of one of the tests that Sanjel does to test how effectively a spacer system can remove mud. The apparatus is immersed in oil based mud to coat it, then it is immersed in the spacer and turned on for a fixed period of time after which the apparatus is removed from the spacer to determine how effective the spacer was at removing the oil based mud.
The VISWEEP DM IS includes a rapid hydrating polymer mixed, weighting material, and pH modifiers to optimize the mixing process, says the company.
Aimed to improve cement bonding, the system uses powdered chemicals to convert oil-wet casing and formations to water-wet. 
This innovation is a particularly valuable asset for longer, complex wells in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, where horizontal sections are common.
While traditional methods have worked for standard vertical wells, when there are horizontal sections, drilling operations face an additional hurdle.
Previously, vertical wells typically reached 3,500 to 4,000 metres. Today, however, wells are commonly 2,500 metres with horizontal sections reaching up to 6,000 metres. This adds to the operation’s hole cleaning and mud displacement workload.
“Batching large spacer volumes may require additional tanks or units, which increases both complexity and the chance of contamination,” says Jeff Spence, Sanjel’s vice-president, operations and innovation, calling it a “labour-intensive process.”
“In the past, if you would hand-mix it, you’d give the operator your recipe, they’d go out to the location, have a series of buckets of and a series of bags of different chemicals and they’d put that all together,” he adds.
At an eight cubic metre volume, VISWEEP DM IS shortens this mixing process from nearly two hours to 15 minutes, says Sanjel.
This system was first used in November 2018 and since then has been used in more than 700 jobs. 
“The technology is really optimized around rapidly achieving properties,” Spence says. “What we wanted to be able to do was mix this on the fly so there are a bunch of efficiency gains for us and for our clients and be able to take a lot of the risk off the table.”
There are some indirect benefits to the environment, as well.
“The energy efficiency aspect of it comes from the amount of time that you’re saving out there,” says Spence. “You don’t have the rig and all the other support equipment sitting around for that 110 minutes of additional mixing time waiting for you to get ready with your spacer to go downhole.”
The emissions savings connected to shopping local supports the case for VISWEEP DM IS, as well.
“A lot of the conventional systems tend to use barite, and barite tends to be sourced out of Asia,” says Spence. “We use, for the most part, a locally-sourced weighting agent that comes out of Alberta.”
Sanjel will clamp down on carbon emissions even further with a new eco-blend line-up of cement.
The company says its new cement has 25 per cent less CO2 output than class G cement, which is standard in the oilfield, and 30 per cent less than the average cement used in Canada.

"2021 Top Operators Report: Back-Office Automation, Data Driven Decision-Making Is Driving Next Wave Of Operational Efficiency | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Editor’s note: Last year, when assembling the 2020 Top Operators Report, the COVID-19 pandemic had shuttered the global economy. Oil demand had been reduced by over 20 million bbls/d and prices were at lows not seen in decades. 
The mood of the Canadian industry was grim. After five years of being rocked by wild price volatility the pandemic hit like a knockout punch. 
The 2021 Top Operators Report looks back at how Canada’s oil and gas leaders pivoted to meet the challenges of 2020, and how they are positioning their organizations for future success. 
Once again, we have tapped into the experience of professional services firm KPMG in Canada to provide insight into what strategies operators could pursue to thrive in the current environment. 
The report also features a broad swath of the insights and opinions from industry leaders gleaned from Daily Oil Bulletin coverage, along with commentary from data providers Evaluate Energy and CanOils.
Download the report here.

The COVID-19 pandemic put many oil and gas operators and oilfield service companies in survival mode.
But that doesn’t mean the push to find operational efficiencies through digital transformation slowed, said Narmin Vasanji, partner, Advisory Services, Management Consulting at KPMG in Canada.
“Working from home proved people could work in different locations. We saw more use of collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams. It forced people to think differently,” she said. “People were thinking of software as a service in the middle of the pandemic. A lot of companies were also looking at data warehouses and data lakes to improve analytics and insights for nimble decision-making.”
“Companies with the resources to weather the storm are now thinking about how to utilize technology and automate. They see it as a competitive advantage,” she added.
The advent of cloud computing is a key driver accelerating the digital transformation, said Vasanji. Larger companies are now accessing their enterprise resource planning (ERP) software over the cloud, providing greater flexibility and easier integration of new data sets. Consolidation in the industry is adding urgency to the shift.
“We’re seeing a lot of consolidation and we will see more consolidation. These all come with synergy targets, often 20-30 per cent in savings,” she said. “Companies need to merge systems and create one source of data truth. For the back office, they need to merge functions post integration, and that creates some challenges. On the operations side there is less impact to staffing but companies always need to get efficiencies out of the transaction.”
“There’s ample opportunity to become more efficient,” she added, highlighting automation in the back office as one often over-looked area. “During the cycle when commodity prices ramp up, companies don’t focus on back office costs. Then there’s a downturn and they layoff employees, leaving those left at the company to perform the jobs of many. The inefficiencies remain.”
Automating repetitive processes is one opportunity, said Vasanji. “Financial processes are a good area to find efficiencies such as invoice automation or automating time sheets from workers in remote locations. This creates capacity for finance teams to focus on forecasting and analysis to help operations make better decisions.”
Even greater opportunities exist through the use of data analytics, said Vasanji. By applying predictive analytics or visualization tools to data, companies can begin to look forward and improve decision-making. For example, basic spend analysis throughout the supply chain to better understand where money is going, to process mining tools that enable visualization of processes to address issues and take action.
Technical data used by geologists, engineers and other disciplines to inform decision-making is also evolving, said Terry Jbeili, geoLOGIC systems ltd. president and chief operating officer. geoLOGIC recently partnered with the Daily Oil Bulletin to survey industry professionals on data usage in current work flows and to identify areas of improvement. The survey results were released in a white paper.
“What we learned is there is a need for technical disciplines within organizations to have easier access to multiple data sets and advanced visualization tools to drive efficiencies,” said Jbeili. “Operational efficiency ranked as the number one reason for using data by the respondents. Other major use cases included project planning and business development (M&A).”
With funds for capital investment in limited supply, Jbeili said having accurate, comparable data and interactive visualization tools to help target spending towards the highest return assets is essential.
“There is an extremely complex interrelationship between reservoir geology, rock characteristics and how different technologies applied during the process of field development interact with the reservoir and affect performance,” said Jbeili. “How well asset teams understand the reservoir and make relevant engineering and technology choices has a major impact on asset value. This requires the ability to validate and integrate numerous data sets and to be able to understand how shifting different variables impacts overall productivity.”
The vast majority of survey respondents reported challenges in integrating different data sets into their workflows. Data silos continue to be a challenge that needs to be addressed, he added.
There is also increasing demand by other technical disciplines to access existing and new data sets, said Jbeili. One example of this is the need for data for environmental disclosures related to ESG reporting. Accessing the needed data sets and visualization tools through cloud computing could help “democratize” data and improve decision-making throughout organizations.
“Cloud computing provides flexibility for lighter data users within large companies who may only use a handful of data sets in their regular workflows,” said Jbeili, adding that in smaller companies it could provide access to data for all disciplines at a lower cost due to not needing to maintain legacy systems.
Forty per cent of survey respondents said their data is cloud-based. Among this number, some companies have totally moved to the cloud, while others are running hybrid systems with some data cloud-based and some hosted internally.
Companies that have migrated data and intelligence tools to the cloud say it provides improved security and lowers costs. Savings are being driven by the reliability of cloud computing, with less downtime experienced by users due to the automation of many processes and with data updates and software updates completed without outages.
Other key benefits to cloud computing cited by survey respondents include scalability, accessibility, flexibility, data and intelligence sharing, and collaboration opportunities — benefits which will only expand as more data sources drive companies’ broadening spectrum of energy intelligence applications, analytics and workflows as well as their need to integrate and report on these data and insights.
It’s not just large companies that can benefit from the digital transformation, Vasanji added. Around one-third of small- and mid-size companies are looking to automate to get rid of paper or are moving to the cloud.
“Everything is scalable,” she said. “There is ERP software for differing sizes of clients, and some are more affordable for smaller companies.”

People The Key To Success Of Digital Transformation In Oil And Gas | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
While digital transformation offers significant opportunities for companies, it’s less about technology than how it’s used and ultimately is all about the people involved, a Petroleum Technology Alliance Canada (PTAC) virtual session heard recently.
“Because innovation is about people, then it's very important to get the people part right, the skills, the culture change and managing that journey,” said Andrea Cherkas, managing director of ClearPath Business, which provides strategic advisory services, most recently focused on digital transformation.
Digital transformation, she said, is simply thinking about how to improve business performance using digital technology, targeting areas such as improving efficiency, productivity, netbacks, cost structure and generating greater return on investment. “Then what we have found is companies move into the opportunity to actually reimagine business processes and models, fundamentally doing things differently.”
Digital transformation is accelerating and it comes down to value creation, creating an opportunity for multiples in value creation, not just incremental improvements, thanks to the significant gains in computing power and data generation, said Cherkas. 
One example of value creation in the Canadian oil and gas industry was the use for the first time of machine learning, using operating history and expertise along with eight years of data to find correlations and make recommendations on extending the run life of a downhole pump. Based on that information, the company was able to extend the run life by nearly 25 per cent with a return on investment of four times, she said.
 Robotic process automation (RPA), basically software (bot) that mimics the actions of a human on a computer in terms of efficiency, is another example of digital innovation, said Cherkas. It helps to automate processes where there are elements of work in which persons might simply be moving data from one system to another, doing uploads and downloads or checking banks of data for outliers. “If there's a workflow that reflects this type of criteria, then it's a candidate for robotic process automation,” she said.
In one case, a ClearPath client identified processes that meet the criteria, mapped the processes and then proceeded to program the bot to upload data and balancing, a monthly process for oil and gas producers. The use of RPA resulted in a 20-fold gain in efficiency, the session heard.
Although digital transformation has risk that needs to be managed, that risk is manageable, said Cherkas. “There are opportunities to utilize and to tap into many different frameworks, tools and processes in order to get your arms around the risk.” For example, companies should make sure they are making decisions in an incremental process as opposed to making “grand big decisions.”
Recognizing the need for companies to develop skills in digital transformation, ClearPath also is working closely with SAIT, which is offering digital business programs that are designed for executive leadership and team leads. “Digital business acumen is imperative and it’s needed to guide and exploit digital shifts as well as adapt the organization accordingly,” she emphasized.
SAIT digital business programs
In SAIT’s digital business programs, industry experts not only develop the content and curriculum but also teach the courses, promoting a new model for innovation and learning, and creating strategic value from digital technology, said Katyryna Gaudet, manager of corporate training at SAIT. “Everything is directly linked to creating value for your business.”
The programs are adaptable to organizational and business models to create tangible value while the learning is relevant and aligns teams for strategic and tactical impact, she said.
“Companies around the world are pouring millions into digital transformation initiatives and a high percentage of those fail,” according to Gaudet. “And that's because companies have put the cart before the horse focusing on specific technologies, rather than starting with fitting the change into their overall business strategy.”
Digital transformation has worked for organizations where their leaders went back to the fundamentals, the session heard. “They're focused on changing the mindset of its employees, as well as the organizational culture and processes before they decide what digital tools and how to use them,” she said. “What the employees envision to be the future of the organization is what drives the technology and not the other way around.”
Gaudet agreed with Cherkas that digital transformation is about people. “And it's the people who will either enable or block the technology,” she said. “So we really look at focusing on that cultural and mindset shift, to leverage technology to meet our changing business, and marketing customer requirements.”
The SAIT program was launched with a $30 million donation from Calgarian David Bissett, who believed that SAIT had the flexibility to respond to the changing needs of industry, she said. Opportunity Calgary also kick-started a fund and invested $8 million over the next five years with a shared commitment to build Calgary's tech talent ecosystem, and the funding of the digital talent hub.

COSIA Releases Reports Showcasing The Latest In Environmental Research | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) released a suite of research reports summarizing 100 research projects related to the areas of land, water and tailings.
The reports highlight research essential to advancing cleantech in the oilsands.
There are four research reports in total — one focused on water, one focused on tailings, with two reports focused on land related to in situ and mining operations, respectively. The research reports, published on COSIA’s website, are available to the public and, in particular, academics and innovators working in the space of environmental innovation.
The reports summarize a variety of oilsands environmental research projects and findings. The land research reports summarize knowledge related to areas such as soils and reclamation materials, revegetation and environmental research and monitoring. A focus for in situ operations is seismic footprint reduction with several research projects underway to explore different technologies that can minimize land disturbance.
“COSIA members work to advance a range of different innovations around land management projects, like the competition we launched earlier this year seeking technologies that reduce the impact of oilsands seismic activities. The initiative is part of our multi-year woodland caribou research and conservation efforts,” said Jack O’Neill, COSIA’s director, land.
The water research report features projects that support minimizing impacts from oilsands mining operations on the Athabasca River watershed. There are 11 active projects around water treatment, one of which looks at SolarPass, a novel technology developed by H2nanO, a start-up company based in Ontario. The technology uses titanium-dioxide nanoparticles and sunlight to treat dissolved organics in oil sands process water.
John Brogly, COSIA’s director, water added: “A key area of focus in our research is pit lakes. In fact, pit lakes planned for the oilsands mining sector are the most thoroughly researched pit lakes on earth with testing done on different scales, ranging from the size of a small swimming pool to an area of eight square kilometres.”
The tailings research report highlights recent progress and work in tailings management — from literature reviews and laboratory projects to large demonstration and commercialization programs. One of the research projects, nicknamed “Bugs and Veggies” is an outdoor growing trial aimed to determine if combining bacterial communities with native plant species might result in technology that enhances the ability of plants to remove water from tailings.
 “Our members are actively developing new and improved technology to mitigate the accumulation of fluid tailings — fine particles in tailings ponds. The goal is to reduce the time frame required to achieve a reclaimed landscape,” said Lucas Barr, COSIA’s director, tailings.

Cenovus In Consortium For Acceleware’s Marwayne RF XL Pilot | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Oilsands tech developer Acceleware Ltd. announced that Cenovus Energy Inc. has joined the commercial-scale RF XL pilot project at Marwayne as a consortium member.
Cenovus will provide funding of up to $2 million and technical expertise in support of the pilot under the terms of an agreement with Acceleware.
In exchange for the funding, Cenovus will be able to provide input into pilot designs and test specifications prior to completion, and will receive, along with the other pilot participants, exclusive access to the full set of detailed technical data and test results for one year following completion of the pilot.
Acceleware has granted Cenovus prioritized rights to host a subsequent test of Acceleware’s RF XL technology, preferred pricing on pre-commercial products, and preferred access to RF XL products over operators who do not participate in the Pilot.
“Getting to a low-carbon energy future is complex and will require a multitude of solutions, a realization that this will be a transition over time, and a lot of players who are willing to actively participate. We are very pleased that Cenovus is coming on board as a third major oilsands partner in our Marwayne RF XL commercial pilot — particularly in light of their participation in the recently announced Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero collaborative initiative,” said Geoff Clark, CEO of Acceleware. “While carbon capture technologies are a terrific and necessary innovation, it’s heartening to also see support for commercialization efforts for next generation technologies such as ours — one that is capable of near zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.”
Acceleware has moved further into the execution phase of the pilot. With the Marwayne site cleared in early 2021, barring unforeseen delays, construction at the site is scheduled to be complete in Q3 2021, with power up and heating following shortly thereafter. While the initial heating phase is planned for approximately six months, this period may be extended to allow Acceleware to capture additional information on the efficiency and operation of the technology.
Cenovus joins two other major oilsands companies (one being Suncor Energy Inc.) who have each agreed to provide technical assistance and up to $2 million in funding for the pilot.
In aggregate, Acceleware’s oilsands partners represent well over one million bbls of oilsands and heavy oil production per day. Acceleware has also received commitments for a total of $15.5 million in funding from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC), Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), and Alberta Innovates.

ESG Matters For OFS During Q1 2021; Companies Take Measures To Lower Emissions | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) remained an important topic for multiple oilfield services companies in their recent Q1 2021 results and conference calls.
Trican Well Services Ltd., for example, discussed its plans to release a sustainability report later this year — hopefully this summer.
“It would be something that we would view as part of our corporate strategy,” Bradley Fedora, president and chief executive officer, said during his company’s Q1 conference call. “A subsector of our corporate strategy would be our ESG strategy. The amount of time and effort we’re spending on that is going to grow, we would anticipate.”
He added: “We’re anticipating we’ll have an annual report out that will have targets, and what we do to meet those targets would be published annually, just like you’ve seen with the larger companies.”
Accessing highline power for its equipment is something Ensign Energy Services Inc. has been doing more and more regularly, Bob Geddes, president and chief operating officer, told his OFS firm’s annual general meeting, with crews tying rigs into grids and even mini grids as the company helps its clients reduce the emissions associated with energy production, maintaining a strong ESG focus.
“Everything we do is with the highest regard for the environment, the safety of our people, and good governance,” he said, adding for many years Ensign has used alternative fuels to power its rigs — notably in the form of natural gas. “[In] a lot of areas we’ve been running produced gas from the areas to run the rigs, which is very emissions-friendly at about half the emissions per barrel of oil produced on the drilling side.”
During this year’s first quarter, Gibson Energy Inc. established expanded sustainability and ESG targets focused on reducing emissions, increasing diversity and inclusion, health and safety, as well as community impact as the near-term priorities, with an overarching goal of being a sustainability and ESG leader relative to its peers.
“We took a major step forward during the quarter by setting ESG and sustainability targets,” Steve Spaulding, president and CEO, told the company’s Q1 conference call. “We put a lot of thought into making sure these targets were impactful to Gibson, and that they were ambitious-yet-achievable.
“On the emissions front, we believe our carbon footprint is best-in-class in the Canadian midstream space on both an emissions-per-revenue basis, and a per-barrel throughput basis. We build on this by reducing our GHG intensity at our facilities by 30 per cent by 2025 and 40 per cent by 2030. We will cut our Scope-2 emissions in half by 2025, and eliminate them entirely by 2030. Importantly, we know how to achieve these targets.”
Precision Drilling Corporation’s ESG-related initiatives produced “encouraging results” during the quarter, most notably on efforts to progress emissions-reduction alternatives for customers.
“This includes formalizing partnerships with green energy providers to expand our offering of hybrid battery energy storage systems, bi-fuel systems and natural gas rig power systems,” said Kevin Neveu, president and CEO. “We are also piloting a GHG monitoring system, which will provide our customers with real-time insights to establish performance baselines and drive continued improvement through the entire operation.”
Meanwhile Total Energy Services Inc. has included continued upgrades of the drilling rig fleet with biofuel and walking systems, which reduces the emissions intensity of the drilling operations, within its 2021 spending plans. Well servicing, as well as the rentals and transportation services segment, are becoming increasingly involved in restoration of old oil and gas well sites to their pre-disturbance condition.
“We also established a partnership with the Aboriginal Skilled Workers Association in order to increase the effectiveness of our Indigenous recruiting efforts,” Daniel Halyk, president and CEO, told his firm’s Q1 conference call. “Apart from dealing with potential future labour shortages, we strongly believe that increased engagement of Indigenous persons in the energy industry is beneficial to all stakeholders.”

Shell Shareholders Increase Pressure For Further Climate Action | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders overwhelmingly backed the company's energy transition strategy on Tuesday, but increased support for a second climate resolution filed by an activist group pointed to growing pressure to tackle climate change.
A non-binding resolution submitted by Shell with the support of a large group of investors to vote on its recently unveiled climate strategy won 88.74 per cent shareholder support at its annual general meeting (AGM) which was held online.
The plan, announced in February, aims to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 by slowly reducing oil and gas output, growing its renewables and low-carbon business and offsetting emissions through carbon capturing technologies and measures such as forestation.
Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden said at the AGM that the strategy, which will be updated every three years, was ""comprehensive... rigorous and... ambitious.""
Shell plans to grow its investment in low-carbon in the coming years, but at least 75 per cent of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas.
Absolute reduction
A second resolution filed by activist group Follow This urging the Anglo-Dutch company to set ""inspirational"" targets to battle greenhouse gas emissions, was rejected by 69.53 per cent of the votes, according to a tally of most votes.
Still, the nearly one-third of votes supporting the resolution, which Shell's board urged shareholders to reject, is a sharp increase from last year's vote where a similar resolution won 14.4 per cent support.
Several investors, proxy advisories and activist groups including Follow This have criticized Shell for setting intensity-based carbon reduction targets, which allow Shell in theory to grow its emissions, rather than absolute reduction targets.
Van Beurden, however, said setting absolute reduction targets would mean Shell will have to unwind its oil and gas business, which would be replaced by other producers.
Follow This director Mark van Baal told Reuters the vote ""tells the board that investors don't accept long-term targets without short and medium-term targets. You need to decrease emissions dramatically and shift investments dramatically in the next decade.""
In a statement following the vote, the Church of England Pension Board, which led the investor talks with Shell on its strategy, welcomed the support for the plan and urged Shell to set short and medium-term targets to reduce emissions in absolute terms.
Adam Matthews, director of ethics & engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board said at the AGM that if Shell doesn't meet its 2023 targets the fund would divest its stake in Shell.
Last week, BP plc investors rejected a Follow This resolution demanding tougher emission reduction targets, which nevertheless was supported by 20.6 per cent of votes.

Trican Sees ‘Growing Interest’ In Tier-4 Equipment; Company Advances On ESG Reporting | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Trican Well Service Ltd. introduced during Q1 2021 the first fracturing pumper in Canada with a CAT Tier-4 dynamic gas blending (DBG) engine, which displaces up to 85 per cent of diesel used in a conventional pumper with clean-burning natural gas, which reduces carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions.
“We’re always looking to invest in technology advances within our industry,” Bradley Fedora, president and chief executive officer, told the Q1 results conference call. “We have the balance sheet to look at anything and everything. We showed that a few weeks back when we announced a three-year deal with one of our customers on a Tier 4 low-emissions fracturing spread. That fracturing spread becomes active in Q4 of this year. We’ll look for more of those.”
Subsequent to the first quarter, the company announced an expansion of its capital budget to $40 million, which includes building a low-emissions Canadian fracturing fleet powered by Tier-4 DGB engines.
“We basically have a three-tiered equipment fleet now,” Fedora said, adding Trican has a conventional horsepower fleet running on diesel, a dual-fuel equipment resulting from retrofits within industry in recent years, which provides 50 to 60 per cent diesel replacement with natural gas, and then there are the Tier-4 engines. “Certainly, we get demand for all, but there’s a growing interest in the Tier-4 technology.”
Oil and gas companies are putting pressure on service providers for cleaner-running, more efficient equipment, he told the conference call. “We could definitely put more of that equipment to work today. It’s just about getting the right pricing and work volume commitments to encourage us to make that investment.
“They’re not cheap, and so we’re not going to put more of that on the street on [speculation], putting it to work for the prices we were seeing in Q1. We need higher prices to justify that kind of investment.”
Other examples of technology implementation include idle-free large pumps in the field, noted the CEO, which likely will expand throughout the fleet. “What that does is shut down the engine when it isn’t being used. It saves on diesel, it saves on emissions, and it saves on repairs and maintenance. It’s a good technology to implement.”
ESG reporting
Regarding its environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach, Trican plans to release a sustainability report later this year — hopefully this summer.
“It would be something that we would view as part of our corporate strategy,” suggested Fedora. “A subsector of our corporate strategy would be our ESG strategy. The amount of time and effort we’re spending on that is going to grow, we would anticipate.”
He added: “We’re anticipating we’ll have an annual report out that will have targets, and what we do to meet those targets would be published annually, just like you’ve seen with the larger companies.”
M&A matters
Recent producer-level consolidations are a positive catalyst for Trican’s strategy of differentiating itself from its competitors, says management. The scale and sophistication of these consolidated companies will increase and their demand for service providers with technical, operational and fiscal capacity will increase as well.
Meanwhile, in terms of Trican’s own activity on the merger-and-acquisition front, Fedora said the company looks at “anything and everything” that is available in Canada, which the firm’s clean balance sheet affords.
“From an M&A perspective, we do look at other service lines from time to time,” he said, adding the company is more flexible on the M&A front in terms of its five-year plan, maintaining a more “M&A-light” approach for the next 12 months. He stressed the company’s interests right now are domestic. “We don’t look at consolidation opportunities in the U.S. or internationally, and we won’t be [doing so] for the foreseeable future.”
Personnel situation
If industry activity continues to grow in the basin, then the ability to hire workers will remain the bottleneck for future crew activations, according to Fedora.
“Although it’s not an issue today, we do expect that if we do increase activity by 10 per cent per year, then [the labour force] will become an issue, and that will become an issue for all service companies, and not just the pressure pumpers. It’ll increase the reactivation times.”
He added: “That, combined with higher reactivation costs that have been previously anticipated, should maintain the market in a fairly tight supply balance.”

Gibson Recognized For Sustainability/ESG Performance; Solidifies Leadership Commitment To Net Zero By 2050 | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Gibson Energy Inc. reports it has received the top “AAA” rating from MSCI ESG Ratings, being only one of three companies globally in the Oil & Gas Refining, Marketing, Transportation & Storage industry and the only company in North America in that industry, to receive this leadership rating.
In addition, building on its recognized sustainability efforts, the company has announced a net zero by 2050 target, which will become the company’s long-term, overarching climate and GHG emission goal. 
“Being a leader as the world transitions to a climate-resilient future is a critical role Gibson is committed to take for our country, business, shareholders and community,” said Steve Spaulding, president and CEO.
“We have a responsibility to ensure a healthy economy is maintained while doing our part in limiting the rise of global temperatures. This can and will be accomplished through sustainable development. This ultimate leadership recognition by MSCI ESG Ratings, which is one of the largest providers of ESG data and analysis, as well as the leadership ratings received from other global rating agencies, recognizes our accomplishments to date and the foundation we have laid for our credible path to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our entire business by 2050.”
Earlier in the year, Gibson announced a series of targets to reduce its GHG intensity and absolute emissions across all its business units by 2025 and 2030, which will become the company’s interim goals along its longer-term path to net zero by 2050.
Within the interim goals, Gibson has committed that by 2030, its overall intensity will be reduced by at least 20 per cent, its processing intensity will be reduced by at least 40 per cent and its storage and handling intensity will be reduced by at least 95 per cent as compared to a 2020 baseline.
Supporting this goal, the company will reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at the Moose Jaw facility by at least 15 per cent by 2025 and fully eliminate its absolute Scope 2 impact from its entire business by 2030.

Progress to date
Gibson said has already made meaningful progress in reducing its GHG emissions, including its recent investment in thermal heat exchanger technology at the Moose Jaw facility as part of a recent $20-million expansion, resulting in a reduction in emissions intensity on a per barrel basis of over 10 per cent.
Continuing its focus on improving the emissions profile of the Moose Jaw facility, the company has also allocated capital within its 2021 budget to further reduce its emissions intensity by switching from a feedstock-based fuel supply to natural gas and continues to consider the impact of GHG emissions as part of its capital review processes for any capital investment opportunity.
To ensure that sustainability and ESG remains a priority, and the company is continuously working towards each of its 2025, 2030 and 2050 targets, 35 per cent of its short-term incentive plan is related to sustainability and ESG performance, including progress towards these targets.

Vermilion Achieves Responsible Producer Certification Through Equitable Origin | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Vermilion Energy Inc. says it has achieved certification under the EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development (2017) from Equitable Origin for three of its natural gas production sites in west-central Alberta: Granada, Eta Lake and Carrot Creek.
Vermilion is the third producer of natural gas in Canada to have achieved this rigorous certification, which is based on an independent assessment of performance targets within five ESG principles: corporate governance, transparency and ethics; human rights, social impact and community development; Indigenous People’s rights; fair labour and working conditions; and climate change, biodiversity and environment.
“This significant achievement demonstrates our continued commitment to the ESG leadership we have established over the past decade, and helps achieve our goal of providing responsibly produced natural gas to the market,” said Curtis Hicks, president of Vermilion. “As the energy transition progresses, we believe it is essential to demonstrate verified excellence in the environmental and social conditions under which energy has been produced, including natural gas. Independent and stringent certifications such as Equitable Origin provide an important signal about operational quality to stakeholders such as our investors, governments and communities.”
Through its site certification program, Equitable Origin provides credible, independent recognition to energy developers that lead their sector in social and environmental performance. Certification for Vermilion’s sites included an independent third-party assessment conducted in June and July 2021, covering a policies and procedures review, in-person field visits, interviews with workers, contractors and management, and meetings with Indigenous leaders, to verify performance.
“In addition to meeting the standard for certification, which includes a commitment to continuous improvement, Vermilion demonstrated leading practices in several areas, including good faith consultation, land rights, community health and safety, and sustainable community investment,” said Soledad Mills, CEO of Equitable Origin.
Under Vermilion’s first certified natural gas transaction, a portion has been committed to supply a natural gas distributor through Macquarie Energy Canada Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group. This transaction is the result of extensive collaboration between Vermilion and the counterparties, along with Validere and Xpansiv, the global marketplace for ESG commodities, which provides the registry that ensures trust through data transparency.

CPAWS Report Highlights Potential Of Seismic Line Restoration For Caribou Protection | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The area surrounding Moon Creek near Grande Cache holds potential for large gains in establishing undisturbed habitat via targeted restoration of seismic lines, which would greatly benefit the region’s caribou populations, says a newly-released Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) report.
However, that work must be coupled with land-use planning so that rehabilitation work by the energy sector is not in essence cancelled out by, for example, logging developments in the immediate area, noted Gillian Chow-Fraser, boreal program manager for CPAWS Northern Alberta.
“On a broader scale, we just need that land-use planning that can look at all of the sectors as well, because we don’t want treatment to be cancelled out by someone building a road right next to an area that has been treated for restoration by one company,” she told the Bulletin. “You kind of need that overarching planning as well to make sure we’re seeing those places that get treated don’t then get re-disturbed immediately, cancelling out all the hard work we’re seeing.”
According to The importance of the Moon Creek area for species at risk recovery: A report on impacts of proposed logging by West Fraser Mills Ltd. (Hinton) in caribou critical habitat, restoration of seismic lines in caribou ranges in Alberta are sometimes confounded by their proximity to existing disturbances, which means it is important to identify areas where the net gains in ‘undisturbed habitat’ are large, without being cancelled out by other disturbance features.
If treated for restoration, say the report authors, then this area has some major seismic lines that would significantly reduce disturbance levels in the range due to minimal overlap with other disturbance types in the area. Restoring just 13 kilometres of critical seismic lines would result in a 61-per-cent gain in the contiguous undisturbed habitat within this compartment, the report suggests. The gains would be in addition to avoiding the loss of undisturbed habitat.
“We didn’t even pick all seismic lines in this area. We picked ones that seemed to be bisecting what undisturbed habitat there is now,” Chow-Fraser said, adding while treating all seismic lines provides even more caribou protection, a lot can be done in the area simply by targeting the “low-hanging fruit” for restoration. “If you do avoid that logging, then it opens up this other area of solutions space, where you make even more significant gains in undisturbed habitat.”
Industry support
Fortunately, the energy sector can be leaders in terms of restoration work needed for caribou protection in Alberta, noted Chow-Fraser. She highlighted the work Cenovus Energy Inc. has done with regards to habitat restoration in the province, and specifically towards seismic-line restoration for caribou. However, more work is required, she noted.
“There’s still a lot of research that has to happen for seismic restoration, and what successful restoration can look like, because it takes decades for these seismic lines to grow back after they’ve been replanted or treated. To that, if it takes 40 years for it to grow back, or however long, then it means there’s such an urgency to start doing that restoration now. Really, the best time was a decade ago.”
She added: “And so, there is that urgency to start making smart decisions right now, so we can see those benefits in the future for caribou.”
Federal plan
The report states that a loss in undisturbed caribou habitat represents a significant blow to federal recovery strategy objectives, impacting Alberta’s “solution space” to maintain sufficient near-term undisturbed winter range habitat for the A La Peche herd, which is key to supporting the population and eventual recovery. As such, CPAWS suggests this area is not suitable for forestry harvesting at intense volumes, based on the best available data on species at risk.
Further, CPAWS recommends the Alberta government assess the potential for restoration of seismic lines in the Moon Creek area, through sub-regional planning, given the quick and significant potential benefits, as intact forest landscapes are important for caribou conservation. Energy firms can do their part as well, noted Chow-Fraser.
“We’re supposed to be aiming for 65 per cent undisturbed habitat in caribou ranges, and we simply aren’t going to get there without seismic restoration. And so, it’s a really key part of it for Alberta.”

"BP, Shell Leaders To Face Congress Over Alleged Climate Cover-Up | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) — Executives from BP plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc will testify before a U.S. House committee investigating allegations that oil giants misled the public about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming.
The hearing planned for later this month by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee follows an investigation by the panel into what it termed a “long-running, industry wide campaign” of climate disinformation.
The investigation comes as reports raise questions about the role of the oil industry, and its allies, in preventing action on global warming by sowing doubt about the dangers of fossil fuels, according to the committee.
Industry representatives have denied wrongdoing.
BP’s top U.S. official, Dave Lawler, plans to testify at a hearing and Shell said it would make an official available as well. Shell Oil Co. president Gretchen Watkins is widely expected to testify on the company’s behalf, according to a person familiar with the matter.
“We are actively advocating for policies, such as carbon pricing and regulating methane, that will support the energy transition, the Paris climate agreement and help the world reach net zero carbon emissions,” BP said in a statement.
Exxon Mobil Corporation is expected to make an official available as well, according to a separate person familiar with the matter. A company spokesman said discussions with committee staff remain ongoing.
Chevron Corporation, which was also asked by the committee to make CEO Michael Wirth available, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.
“API [American Petroleum Institute] welcomes the opportunity to testify again before the House Oversight Committee and advance our priorities of pricing carbon, regulating methane and reliably producing American energy,” Bethany Aronhalt, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based trade group, said in an email. 
The committee announced the probe in September and requested a trove of documents from the companies. Among them were communications from company executives on climate science, climate change, clean energy and the role of fossil fuels in causing climate change. The committee also said it was seeking documents regarding the influencing of public opinion and communications with the government and the White House.
“We are deeply concerned that the fossil fuel industry has reaped massive profits for decades while contributing to climate change that is devastating American communities, costing taxpayers billions of dollars, and ravaging the natural world,” committee leaders wrote to company executives. “We are also concerned that to protect those profits, the industry has reportedly led a co-ordinated effort to spread disinformation to mislead the public and prevent crucial action to address climate change.”
A committee spokeswoman didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

China Puts Energy Security First While Doubling Down on Renewables | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Two speeches from China’s top leaders delivered just days apart have provided the most insight yet into the bumpy and contentious path the country will likely take to cut the world’s biggest source of planet-warming emissions.
President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang painted a portrait of a country that plans to put national security — including from energy shortages — and development first, even as it pursues a green transition. The country will put huge investments into its world-leading renewable energy sector, while also continuing to support fossil fuels that provide the bulk of its energy.
Every economy trying to reach net-zero faces the challenge of maintaining energy security while moving away from fossil fuels, though China is under special pressure to move quickly. It’s the world’s second-biggest economy and largest emitter, and no solution to climate change will work without it. The country still considers itself a developing nation trying to lift more citizens into relative prosperity, the same position countries like the U.K. and U.S. were in a century ago when profligate pollution wasn’t a geopolitical issue.
China’s dilemma has been thrown into sharp focus by a global energy crunch that risks slowing growth and creating social unrest.
That crisis was the topic of a Saturday meeting of several top leaders, where Premier Li delivered his speech. He warned that the nation’s green transition needs to be underpinned by a stable supply of energy and called for an in-depth assessment of the recent power crunch before setting any short-term targets for reaching peak emissions. Production of coal, natural gas and oil are still important to the country’s success and security, he said.
Days later, at a United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, Xi offered his rejoinder, saying environmental goals have to be both “ambitious” and “pragmatic.” He announced on Tuesday that China had started construction on a giant renewable energy project in the country’s vast deserts that’s bigger than all the wind and solar power in India, as part of its plan to reach net-zero by 2060.
“Short-term boosts of coal and coal-power production doesn’t necessarily contradict the country’s long-term decarbonization goals,” said Beijing-based BloombergNEF analyst Jonathan Luan. “Top leaders’ public support for renewables after widespread power cuts at least shows that they believe the growth in clean energy will help energy security.”
Still, the energy crisis may constrain China’s ability to make new commitments at high-stakes international climate talks known as COP26 that kick off in Glasgow, Scotland, at the end of the month. A major goal is to agree on a deadline to phase out coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.
China mines and burns half the world’s supply, and is pushing its producers to boost output to ease power shortages. It has also allowed coal power prices to rise by as much as 20 per cent, double the current limit, a dramatic intervention in a market that China had sought to keep stable in order to ensure predictable costs for industrial users.
Even as governments remain focused on securing coal and gas for the winter, the global energy crisis is in some places accelerating the longer-term transition to cleaner and less volatile sources of power generation. In Spain, authorities have plans to support 3.3 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy. The U.K., one of the countries that’s been hit the hardest by fuel shortages and power disruptions, is aiming to phase out fossil fuel-generated electricity by 2035 by relying in part on nuclear.
China is no exception. Construction has started on the first phase of a project to add 100 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, Xi said. The news echoed an unconfirmed report that China is planning a 400-gigawatt project in the desert, with half the capacity to be constructed by 2025. A likely location is western China, where existing and planned power lines can link renewables projects to megacities in the east.
“Renewables stand to win” from Chinese policies aimed at easing the electricity crisis, said Tony Fei, an analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. “The trend is clear that renewable power generation and consumption will enjoy a premium on government support.”
Saturday’s meeting was the fifth time the National Energy Commission has gathered since it was founded in 2010. The group’s mandate is to strategize on issues including energy security. According to a readout, Li emphasized that China’s emission-reduction goals shouldn’t be “rushed,” and arbitrary power cuts should be corrected.
Han Zheng, one of China’s seven most powerful leaders who’s in charge of implementing Xi’s net-zero goal, serves as vice chair. His presence indicates that the road map for cutting emissions would take into account concerns about energy security and the impact of rising energy prices on the public, especially poorer citizens.
That complicates how far China can go to portray itself as a climate leader on the international stage. Xi has sought to leverage co-operation on tackling global warming to counter pushback from the West over everything from trade to the coronavirus and human rights.
“The energy crisis is making a set of major climate moves very complicated,” said Li Shuo, a campaigner with Greenpeace. At COP26 and the Group of 20 summit immediately preceding it, China will come under pressure to end domestic coal use. “What’s happening at home does not leave a lot of leeway for Chinese negotiators there,” he said.
Growing unhappiness in regions struck by the power crunch — especially in the northeast where residential use has been affected — has pushed the government to shift its short-term priorities, said Qin Yan, an analyst at Refinitiv. But the latest push to boost coal doesn’t go against the nation’s climate plan for 2021 to 2025, where the goal was always to restrict the growth of the fuel’s use, not decrease it.
It does make it less likely that China will move forward its 2030 target for reaching peak emissions, Qin said, something other countries have pressed it to do. China has promised to come to COP26 with more aggressive climate goals, and it’s surprised the international community with unexpected pledges over the last year or so, including its net-zero target and a promise to stop building overseas coal plants.
At the Kunming conference, Xi pledged to establish a biodiversity fund with an initial investment of 1.5 billion yuan ($232 million). Environmentalists expressed disappointment that he didn’t announce more ambitious conservation targets to help member countries work toward goals including to protect 30% of world’s lands and oceans by 2030.
The summit underscored the challenges for COP26 negotiators. “Without tangible actions on the table, the world will agree on yet another set of targets with no commitment to delivering them,” said Georgina Chandler, senior policy officer at Britain’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

RETI And Shell Execute MOU To Co-Develop Polaris CCS Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Reconciliation Energy Transition Inc. (RETI), an affiliate company of Project Reconciliation (PRI), has executed memorandum of understanding with Shell Canada Products to collaborate on Shell’s proposed Polaris carbon capture and storage project.
Under terms of the MOU, RETI will work with its First Nations partners to raise funds for a potential agreement to acquire an equity position in the Shell-led Polaris CO2 storage hub concept.
Project Reconciliation’s vision of Indigenous generational wealth is supported by the Indigenous Sovereign Wealth ESG Fund 1, which will champion investments in low-carbon clean energy projects, such as Polaris.
Funding for these projects will be made through special purpose limited partnerships, which will include equity loans for First Nations partners, in turn providing material ownership for First Nations.
These investments will support environmental stewardship and create pension-like intergenerational wealth — thereby supporting the path towards healing, respect and self-determination for participating Nations.
The proposed Polaris CCS project is being developed on Treaty 6 lands and home to Papaschase First Nation.
“We welcome this opportunity to protect our environment and take climate action through Project Reconciliation’s vision and Shell's commitment to environmental leadership,” added Chief Calvin Bruneau, Papaschase First Nation. “We are making progress towards official recognition by the federal government. Our partnership in this project is an important step towards being more recognized and respected on our traditional lands — while protecting it for our future generations.”
RETI said its focus is to develop new energy transition projects founded on material Indigenous equity ownership at the operating level. Its strong engagement platform and governance structure is deeply aligned with PRI’s; created to accelerate Canada’s Indigenous generational wealth base where Indigenous people have meaningful oversight and economic participation in Canada’s evolving energy transition and decarbonization economy. RETI’s mandate emphasizes free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), with ESG performance as the foundation of its development strategy.
“As chairman of Project Reconciliation, I am proud of our partnership with Shell Canada, a leading energy provider in accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions through initiatives such as the Polaris Project,” said Robert Morin, who is also member of Enoch Cree Nation. “These alliances are an important step in achieving our vision of Indigenous economic sovereignty and self-determination.”
Stephen Mason, chairman and CEO of RETI and managing director of Project Reconciliation, added: “RETI’s collaboration with Shell underlines that material partnerships between Indigenous Peoples and Corporate Canada are critical to the development of today’s infrastructure projects.”

"Shortage Of Rig Workers Could Slow Canadian Oilpatch Recovery, Industry Warns | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(The Canadian Press) — Canadian energy contractors are facing a shortage of rig workers that could slow oilpatch recovery.
Oil and gas companies are ramping up production to meet global energy demand as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Oil prices are at seven-year highs, with West Texas Intermediate trading this week at more than US$80/bbl.
The Canadian Association of Energy Contractors says there were 175 active drilling rigs in Canada last week, compared to just 75 in the same period last year. It says employment in the sector has increased 130 per cent year-over-year.
But the industry group says labour shortages are a problem. It says some companies who can’t find workers are struggling to fill customer demand for rigs.
Companies are finding it difficult to attract workers back to the oil and gas sector after a six-year economic downturn. Some rig workers have left Western Canada while others have retrained in other industries.
The CAOEC says wages for rig workers have already increased by about 10 per cent from last year due to market demand.

"Shell Flags $400 Million Hurricane Hit, But Boost From Soaring Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
 (Reuters) — Royal Dutch Shell plc warned on Thursday of a $400 million hit to third-quarter earnings from the damage caused by August's Hurricane Ida.
However, in an update ahead of quarterly results this month, the oil major also flagged a boost to cash flows from soaring natural gas and electricity prices.
Gas and power prices have been surging as tight gas supplies have collided with strong demand in economies recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell is the world's top seller of LNG accounting for about 20 per cent of global demand, though its sales have declined in recent months because of production problems.
The company said third-quarter cash flow at its LNG division ""is expected to be significantly impacted by large variation margin inflows on the back of the prevailing gas and electricity price environment"".
Shell will be holding more cash from buyers as deposits in the face of the large fluctuations in gas prices. The cash will eventually flow back out as prices cool.
Liquefaction in the quarter is expected to be between 7 and 7.5 million tonnes, the lowest since 2016, ""reflecting feedgas constraints and additional maintenance"", Shell said.
LNG earnings will, however, receive a boost from stronger trading results, it added.
Shell's upstream oil and gas production fell in the quarter to between 2.025 and 2.1 million boe/d owing to a prolonged outage of about 90,000 boe/d at some of its offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida.
Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, said sales volumes were expected to be between 4.3 and 5.3 million bbls/d, the highest since the first quarter of 2020 but still well below pre-pandemic levels.
Refinery utilization rates will be impacted by outages due to Hurricane Ida.
In the second quarter, Shell boosted its dividend by 38 per cent for a second consecutive quarter and launched a $2 billion share buyback program following the sharp rise in oil and gas prices.

Higher Natural Gas Prices To Drive Exxon Q3 Earnings | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Exxon Mobil Corporation signalled on Thursday that higher oil and gas prices would boost third-quarter earnings by as much as $1.5 billion over the second quarter.
Natural gas prices in the United States have more than doubled this year and oil prices are up 52 per cent as energy demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exxon also has been cutting costs and laying off personnel following a historic loss in 2020. Lower costs coupled with the recent rebound in oil and gas have driven profit sharply higher.
Natural gas prices should give the U.S. oil producer the largest increase in operating profit in the quarter, the company signalled in a corporate filing. Profit from natural could rise US$500–$900 million this quarter over last, it said.
U.S. natural gas prices were trading at almost $6/mmBtu on Thursday.
Healthier refining margins could add from $500 million to $700 million in operating profits this quarter. Exxon quarter results will be posted on Oct. 29.
Chemical margins, on the other hand, could cut operating profit by between $200 million and $400 million in the quarter, the company said in the filing.
It also said unsettled derivatives could reduce operating profit from oil and gas production by $100–$500 million in the period.
Last year, the company suffered a $680 million loss in the third quarter on lower oil prices and production volumes.

"Oxbow Deal Makes For ‘Historic’ Q2, Says Saturn; Company Reactivating Shut-In Production | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Saturn Oil & Gas Inc. experienced a “historic quarter” in Q2 2021, says executive management, as the company completed its Oxbow asset acquisition, providing a “substantial platform” for future growth via drilling opportunities and production and production-optimization projects.
“This asset has drastically accelerated the company’s growth strategy,” John Jeffrey, chief executive officer, told this morning’s second quarter conference call. “The acquisition has tripled the number of light-oil drilling locations that Saturn has in its inventory.
“It has a long list of optimization opportunities for low-cost workovers and economic production growth, and the asset also delivers a stable cash-flow stream to fund these initiatives. Saturn has achieved a strategic advantage in its key areas by owning and operating the pipelines, processing facilities and general infrastructure.”
He added: “Acquiring the Oxbow asset has opened up a substantial fairway of acquisition opportunities that’ll have an excellent tactical fit for Saturn in the future.”
In terms of effectively integrating Oxbow into the company’s portfolio, Jeffrey said that adding the “right people” and putting in the “right systems” is key. “And so, growing from several hundred barrels per day to several thousand barrels per day requires major upgrades to our accounting production software, and it’s the same with human resource programs and a bunch of other initiatives.
“What we’ve kind of been focused on in the last few months is just getting those programs in place, getting those key players in place, as we mentioned earlier, and we’re happy to report now that the integration program has been very smooth, it’s ahead of schedule and it has been very successful.”
With this deal, the firm has a long-term steady cash flow source it is re-deploying to increase shareholder value. Saturn is immediately focused on debt repayment and concurrently directing a portion of free cash flow to fund its inventory of production growth projects.
“Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for Saturn,” said chief financial officer Scott Sanborn. “The accelerated repayment of debt increases the company’s financial capacity for future acquisitions.”
Production reactivation
Saturn’s average production during the second quarter and first half of 2021 was 1,875 and 1,058 boe/d, respectively, compared with 136 and 410 boe/d during the same 2020 timeframes. Production increases reflect those newly-acquired Oxbow assets, which averaged about 6,400 boe/d for the 23 days following the closing of the deal.
Production from the company’s Viking assets located in west-central Saskatchewan produced about 240 bbls/d in Q2 2021, which is up 76 per cent from Q2 2020. The increase in production is a result of the reactivation of previously shut-in wells following an oil-price recovery from early on in the pandemic.
Crews will reinitiate Viking drilling during the third quarter, with the expected drilling of three extended-reach horizontal (ERH) wells and workovers of existing wells for total expected capital expenditures of $4.5 million. The company has surveyed locations for the three wells, which crews should spud in September. The company has been reinstating its drilling program following its suspension last year due to COVID-19.
In terms of Oxbow, Saturn anticipates completing an operated drilling program in the fourth quarter, with further details to be provided as management finalizes capital budgets.
“Our Q3 program has been extremely successful so far,” said Justin Kaufmann, vice-president of exploration. The company has brought online roughly 100 bbls/d so far by working over 10 wells, he noted. “We also JV’d two non-operating wells in southeastern Saskatchewan.”
He added: “This was a great opportunity for Saturn, as we were able to open the playbook of a competitor to aid in our own development program in Q4.”
Q2 2021 results
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, petroleum and natural gas sales totalled $12.59 million and $13.91 million, respectively, compared to $426,000 and $3.59 million for the same periods last year.
Saturn reported net losses of $29.6 million and $31.13 million in Q2 and the first half of this year, respectively, compared with net losses of $3.02 million and $2.37 million for the same 2020 periods. Management attributes the net loss increases to losses on commodity contract derivatives, partially offset by more funds flow and Oxbow deal gain.
According to the company’s Q2 financial and operational results, Saturn now has two growth vehicles, the Viking and Oxbow assets, which collectively hold more than 550 identified drilling locations representing 20-plus years of inventory. There are also several existing-but-non-producing wells with optimization potential. There are more than 400 non-producing candidate wells that Saturn can return to economic production over the coming years, it said.

Pipestone Energy Corp. has appointed Kim Anderson to its board of directors.
Anderson will also serve as a member of the audit committee. Anderson is currently the chief financial officer of Heartland Generation, and prior to that was chief financial officer of Athabasca Oil Corporation.
Anderson holds a bachelor of commerce degree from the Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary and is a chartered professional accountant.
Share distribution
Pipestone Energy’s largest single shareholder, Canadian Non-Operated Resources L.P., is in the process of being dissolved and as such has distributed its 103,750,000 common shares of Pipestone Energy to its limited partners.
As a result, and based on information publicly filed, Riverstone V REL CNOR LP now beneficially owns 47,159,714 common shares and its affiliate Riverstone Pipestone LP continues to own 52,690 convertible preferred shares, representing an aggregate approximate 40.5 per cent of the voting securities of Pipestone Energy (on a notional as-converted basis of the preferred shares as of the date of the distribution); and Al Mehwar Commercial Investments LLC, an affiliate of Amwal Investments LLC, now beneficially owns 31,439,809 common shares, representing approximately 11.2 per cent of the voting securities of Pipestone Energy.
The remainder of CNOR LP’s common shares, being 25,150,477 common shares representing an approximate nine per cent of the voting securities of Pipestone Energy, were distributed to the other limited partners of CNOR LP with no public filings issued.
The CNOR LP nomination agreement, dated Jan. 4, 2019, which entitled it to nominate three directors for election to the Pipestone board for so long as it held in excess of 30 per cent of the common shares, has been terminated. In its place Riverstone can now nominate two directors for election to the Pipestone board pursuant to the Riverstone LP nomination agreement dated effective Sept. 15, 2020 for so long as it and its affiliates hold in excess of 20 per cent of the voting securities of the company.
Currently, Riverstone is represented on the Pipestone board by Robert Tichio and Jesal Shah. Pipestone has also entered into a new nomination agreement with Al Mehwar, providing that Al Mehwar can nominate one director for election to the Pipestone board for so long as it or its affiliates collectively hold in excess of 10 per cent of the voting securities of the company.
CNOR LP has assigned its existing registration rights agreement with Pipestone Energy dated effective Jan. 4, 2019 to Riverstone V, which provides for four customary “prospectus demand rights,” three of which have been waived by Riverstone V.
Riverstone therefore has a total of four prospectus demand rights considering the three existing rights that Riverstone LP has pursuant to the registration rights agreement dated effective Sept. 15, 2020 among Riverstone LP, GMT Capital Corp. and the company.
Following the distribution, all of the outstanding investor rights for significant shareholders are summarized above, plus those rights held by GMT Capital, which was not involved in the distribution, pursuant to the preferred share investor registration rights agreement, being two customary prospectus demand rights and piggy-back rights; and GMT Capital is entitled to nominate one director for election to the Pipestone board pursuant to the GMT Capital nomination agreement dated effective Sept. 15, 2020 for so long as it, its affiliates or GMT Exploration Company LLC holds in excess of 10 per cent of the voting securities of the company.
Certain hedge fund and private client accounts of GMT Capital beneficially own 20,424,509 common shares and 11,540 preferred shares, representing 15.1 per ent of the voting securities of Pipestone Energy.

"Molten Salt Reactors Revived From Early Days Of Nuclear Age Promoted For Safety, Flexibility | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
But for some fateful decisions made in the early days of the nuclear age, fission reactor designs may have taken an entirely different route, where meltdowns could have been avoided and the power of the atom may have spread to many other applications unsuited to today’s water-cooled reactor design virtually universally adopted.
At least, that’s what some backers of molten salt reactors believe. One of them is in the running for Canada’s first grid-scale small modular reactor (SMR) installations in Ontario scheduled for operations in 2028, followed by potential rollout in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in the 2030s.
Terrestrial Energy Inc. is a leading proponent of the Generation IV molten salt reactor first demonstrated in the U.S. in the 1960s. The Oakville, Ontario-based company is one of three shortlisted for demonstration of SMR technology at the Darlington nuclear power station 70 kilometres east of Toronto.
The only Canadian technology candidate, it is up against nuclear power veteran GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and U.S.-based start-up X-energy. Terrestrial touts its reactors’ ability to produce high quality heat for their suitability for oilsands production (please see: High Heat Molten Salt SMRs Fit For Alberta Purposes).
Ontario Power Generation, SaskPower and Bruce Power, subsidiary of Calgary-based TC Energy Corporation, will select the winning company by the end of this year. The DOB is looking at each company’s technology in the run-up to a selection of one company to site a first reactor in Ontario.
Wrong road?
To understand the distinction between light water, or pressurized water, reactors and those moderated and cooled with other materials — including sodium, salt, molten metals and gases like helium — it is useful to look at the fateful decisions made in the early days of the nuclear age that some believe set it on the wrong course from the beginning.
Light water reactor (LWR) technology used in virtually all of the approximately 440 commercial reactors operating in the world today won out over all the others not so much because it was better, as that it was among the first techniques developed and was initially not seen to present any nuclear weapons proliferation risk.
The solid fuel powered, water-cooled reactors were an appropriate fit for nuclear powered submarines, for example, that was one of the earliest applications of nuclear power. Further down the development curve than most of the alternatives, LWRs were chosen by the U.S. in the 1950s as the model for widespread commercialization, despite their drawbacks — some of which only later became apparent.
Among their shortcomings is water’s relatively low boiling point of just 100 C. That can be increased to around 300 C by pressurizing the reactor vessel, but that introduces other complications. The flow of water must be maintained to prevent the solid fuel from overheating and melting, for instance, potentially leading to core meltdown and rupture of the pressure vessel, leading to catastrophic release of nuclear contamination.
The other major downside relates to nuclear waste and proliferation. It was initially envisioned that LWR spent fuel — still containing usable uranium — would be reprocessed in a closed-loop model that would use up most of the fuel over time — in part by creating a new generation of sodium-cooled breeder reactors that would, among other things, recycle and further deplete the fuel to more manageable levels.
However, that process involves the creation of plutonium, and the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation — should that plutonium find its way into the wrong hands — soon became obvious. That put an end to that closed-loop scenario as countries around the world moved in the 1970s to ban the commercial reprocessing upon which that system was to rely, resulting in a growing nuclear waste stockpile. Today, there are some 300,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel that may require safe storage for over 200,000 years.
Reviving a 1960s reactor concept
Meanwhile, a technology under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee may have sidestepped many of those issues — with a molten fluoride salt reactor demonstrated in the 1960s. Rather than using solid fuel, the reactors mix uranium (or spent nuclear fuels, plutonium or the more common thorium) into a molten salt mix, with about the consistency of water, in which the fuel undergoes fission.
“The design was radical for its time, and offered many advantages worth a fresh look today,” according to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
Because the fuel is already molten, conventional nuclear plant meltdowns would be physically impossible — the salts have a boiling point far higher than any temperature the fission products could produce. “Replacing water as the coolant removes possibility of steam explosions and generation of flammable hydrogen gas. Low pressure operation also places less demand on containment systems,” said the PNNL.
Increasing heat would cause the salt mix to expand, dampening the chain reaction. “In the event of an unanticipated rise in temperature, this expansion shuts down the reaction.”
Further, a freeze plug at the bottom of the reactor vessel is designed to melt in higher temperatures, causing the mixture to empty into a holding tank where the mixture would cool and solidify, indefinitely containing the fission products within. “This option provides a failsafe in the event of power outages or other events.”
Potentially dangerous products like plutonium would not be isolated in such a system. They could remain in circulation in the reactor and continue fissioning until completely consumed. And because these reactors can operate at higher temperatures, their steam cycle generates electricity more efficiently and they could be used for higher temperature industrial applications.
However the salts can be highly corrosive, necessitating more work to understand and mitigate the corrosion of structural materials. Risk assessment and licensing for a non-LWR design would need to be undertaken, according to the PNNL.
Ongoing research at ORNL examining new materials to deal with the chemically corrosive nature of the salts was cut short when that program was shut down in 1973 — and largely forgotten for three decades.
Back to the future 
Terrestrial is among the new breed of nuclear start-ups returning to designs abandoned in the early days of nuclear experimentation. Its molten salt technology is the same route being taken by Bellevue, Washington-based TerraPower, established in 2008 by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates. TerraPower states that the higher operating temperature reactors are well suited to provide the kind of heat needed for petroleum cracking and plastics manufacture. The U.S. government has also resumed the study of molten salt reactors.
Terrestrial’s SMR is closely related to molten salt reactor pioneered at ORNL — J.R. “Dick” Engel, who was ORNL chief engineer when the technology was under development in the 1960s, was a member of Terrestrial’s technical team until his death in 2017. Terrestrial updates the concept with the key innovation of a completely sealed Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) core unit.
“IMSR genealogy and design choices give high technology readiness [to] technologies based closely on molten salt reactor technology demonstrated at Oak Ridge National Lab. It builds on 60 years of Oak Ridge National Lab reactor design work and on many other demonstrated technologies,” Terrestrial CEO Simon Irish told an Alberta Innovates webinar earlier this year.
The IMSR core-unit “ensures industrial requirements have inherent safety, operational simplicity, and a 90 per cent-plus utility factor are achieved. And they're achieved by the integration of the primary reactive components, the reactor core, the moderator, the primary heat exchanger and the pumps, into a sealed reactive vessel within a compact and replaceable unit that has an operating life of seven years, and then it is replaced with another core unit,” he said.
The sealed core allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel on-site. The liquid fuel salt provides an integral system in which the nuclear fuel, coolant and heat transfer medium provide a less complex configuration with “passive and inherent safety” features making them “walk-away” safe, the company says.
With control safety inherently part of the reactors fundamental physics characteristics, no operator action, electricity or externally-powered mechanical components are needed to assure the primary safety functions of controlling, cooling and containing the reaction. Following assembly, the reactor can be lowered into a surrounding guard vessel located in a below grade reactor silo.
The IMSR power plant generates 195 megawatts of electricity with a thermal-spectrum, graphite-moderated, molten-fluoride-salt reactor system. Two IMSR power plants would power a city the size of Denver or Vancouver.
Challenges remain
To be sure, molten salt reactors have their critics. In a September commentary in The Conversation, M.V. Ramana, Simons Chair in Disarmament, Global and Human Security at the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia, said they retain many of the challenges of all nuclear reactors, including costs and safety.
Ramana argues the molten salt reactor experiment that operated intermittently from 1965 to 1969 was less than successful, with operations interrupted 225 times, only 58 of which were planned. “The remaining were due to various unanticipated technical problems. In other words, the reactor had to be shut down at least once every four out of five weeks — that is not what one would expect of a reliable power plant.”
Difficult questions raised about the technology by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission remain technical challenges confronting molten salt reactors designs today, he said. For example, the corrosive nature of the hot salts remains unresolved, with the Idaho National Laboratory recommending as recently as 2018 that “a systematic development program be initiated” to develop new alloys that might work better.
Indeed, molten salt reactors are still far from proven, Ramana stated, quoting France’s Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire that said in 2015: “numerous technological challenges remain to be overcome before the construction of an MSR can be considered,” and maintaining that it does not envision construction of such reactors “during the first half of this century.”
Despite about a hundred billion dollars spent worldwide since 1950, sodium-cooled reactors have been commercial failures globally, according to Ramana, who notes nuclear power is only getting more expensive compared to other low-carbon options, like solar and wind, that keep getting cheaper. He quotes Peter Bradford, a former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission official, who likened the use of nuclear power to mitigate climate change to fighting world hunger “with caviar.”
“The climate crisis is far more urgent,” than to wait decades for reactors to be demonstrated, Ramana concluded. “Investing in technologies that are proven to be problematic is no way to deal with this emergency.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists has also detailed the safety and security risks associated with MSR designs, finding in a report in March that most non-LWR technologies “do not offer obvious improvements over LWRs significant enough to justify their many risks.” It recommended among other things that the U.S. DOE and Congress should consider focusing nuclear energy R&D on improving the safety and security of LWRs, rather than on commercializing immature non-LWR designs.

High Heat Molten Salt SMRs Fit For Alberta Purposes | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Nuclear power plants have long been considered to supply the ravenous heat and power needs of bitumen production. But reactors of the past never quite fit the bill.
The production techniques used by both mining and in situ oilsands producers are heavily reliant on natural gas today. And so energy intensive are those methods that natural gas combustion is a major component of the sector’s excessive per bbl greenhouse gas emissions.
A carbon free energy source could therefore be a boon to producers anxious to cut emissions in the new net-zero emissions-targeted world.
But the large-scale nuclear power plants of the past were ill-suited to the task. Not only are they too large for the job, but they produce relatively low temperature heat — and the resulting steam does not transport very far.
Manufacturers of some of today’s Generation IV small modular reactors (SMRs) believe they have solved those shortcomings by reviving the molten salt cooled nuclear reactor technology first piloted in the 1960s (please see: Molten Salt Reactors Revived From Early Days Of Nuclear Age Promoted For Their Safety, Flexibility).
The reactors, anticipated to be commercial by the end of the decade, provide the smaller size and higher temperatures that could make them a nice fit for the oilsands, according to Simon Irish, chief executive officer of Oakville, Ontario-based Terrestrial Energy Inc.
“In terms of alternative sources of energy that are clean, the Generation III nuclear cannot help,” the oilsands, Irish told an Alberta Innovates webinar earlier this year. “This has been studied already. In 2003, the Canadian Energy Research Institute concluded that conventional nuclear, namely Generation III technologies facilities, are too large, their steam pressures are too low and inflexible, and the steam that they generate cannot be transported far enough. These conclusions were echoed by further study by Petroleum Technology Alliance Canada (PTAC) in 2009.
“But the Generation IV [molten salt reactor], because [it] operates at a much higher temperature, it has the ideal size, it has the ideal steam temperature, to deliver game-changing environmental impacts in oilsands production. It can be an industrial baseload reliable, cost-competitive source of energy, to create the clean steam to support oilsands production.”
Terrestrial is among almost a dozen nuclear power producers looking to revive the nuclear industry in Canada with new SMR concepts promising to be more cost competitive and faster to build than the bespoke and capital-intensive nuclear power plants of the past. It is projected their modularity and mass production in factories could substantially reduce costs and make them viable as baseload and load-following power producers.
Heat the secret sauce
But more compact design and mass production alone won’t necessarily change the economic fortunes of nuclear power, Irish noted in a blog posted in August. SMRs need to compete against the economies of scale found in conventional full-scale reactors, which themselves are generally not economic to build today. All else equal, smaller plants may cost less to build, but the electricity they produce will be more expensive.
A conventional nuclear plant operates at just 32 per cent thermal efficiency, a coal plant at 45 per cent and a gas plant at more than 50 per cent, mainly due to the temperature of operation and “heat quality” of each, he said.
Conventional technologies, including Canada’s CANDU that uses heavy water (deuterium) rather than light water, and even modern boiling water and pressurized water reactors all have the same limitation: low-quality heat and low thermal efficiency, he said. These water-cooled and moderated reactor technologies that top out at about 300 C “lock conventional nuclear power generation into a low-efficiency economic box with low-quality heat from which the laws of physics offer no escape.”
Today’s Generation IV technologies “on the verge of commercialization” can produce high-quality heat capable of step-change improvements in thermal efficiency and economics, he maintains. Terrestrial’s ability to deliver high-grade heat with its 195-megawatt Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR)  — with core inlet and outlet coolant temperatures of 620 and 700 degrees Celsius — drives net thermal efficiency to 44 per cent, while making it adequate for widespread industrial use, such as for chemical processing, and hydrogen and ammonia production.
“This is a level of efficiency nearly 50 per cent higher than conventional nuclear power plants. By any economic standard, a 50 per cent improvement is a game-changer, especially in an industry that has measured progress in small single-digit increments. By achieving such high thermal efficiency, Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR lowers the cost of every kilowatt-hour generated by a third; waste is also reduced by more than a third,” Irish stated.
“By deploying Generation IV technologies with innovative designs, we can demonstrate to the world that nuclear power is not only reliable and clean but also a cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels and can finally stand on its own two feet.”
Hydrogen application
Further, Irish pointed to the potential for SMRs to produce hydrogen at scale — something considered necessary to build the low-carbon hydrogen economy of the future. He notes producing green hydrogen via electrolysis of water takes five to six times the amount of energy to remove hydrogen from water than from producing hydrogen from methane, and that “energy is money… You're going to find it very, very difficult to compete with natural gas.”
However, since producing H2 via steam methane reforming of natural gas emits large quantities of CO2, that CO2 must be captured and stored (CCS) in order to make it low carbon. A third option could be pyrolysis of natural gas using nuclear power, with the advantage of producing solid carbon as a byproduct.
Gaseous CO2 and solid carbon have “very different implications with respect to sequestering… [CO2] is generally expensive and challenging to sequester. And sequestering tends to be very site-specific.”
“Solid carbon is much more straightforward to sequester [and] from an economic perspective, it's more attractive as well,” as it may even have some value, he said. “So it's not surprising there is an escalating interest in methane pyrolysis, as it uses natural gases as feedstock, but solid carbon [as a byproduct] considerably eases the CCS challenges and costs.”
Terrestrial estimates its IMSR can generate dispatchable power at a levelized cost of under US$50 per megawatt-hour, making it cost-competitive with natural gas and coal, while in industrial heat markets it has the potential to be cost-competitive with natural gas and heating oil.
Load following is facilitated by its negative temperature coefficient of reactivity: a decrease of heat extraction from the unit leads to an increased coolant temperature, which lowers reactivity resulting in a reactor power decrease, and vice versa when heat extraction is increased.
Mass-manufactured in factories and transported by truck or rail for on-site assembly, the modular reactors can be brought to market quickly, with a four-year time horizon, less than half the time required for conventional nuclear power plants, at an upfront investment of less than $1 billion rather than $10 billion plus for conventional power plants, claims Terrestrial. The company expects the first IMSR power plants to come online in the late 2020s.
In September, Terrestrial announced an upgraded IMSR plant design, the IMSR400 — a facility with a net 390 MW of electric generation capacity for grid supply from twin reactors and generators. The upgrade was made in response to utility requirements, the company said.
It uses nuclear fuel at standard enrichment — the only Generation IV SMR power plant designed to do this today. That avoids the considerable cost and time of re-licensing uranium enrichment plants and removes hurdles to commercialization. The company announced an agreement in August with Westinghouse and the U.K.’s National Nuclear Laboratory to provide the IMSR’s nuclear fuel supply, the first Generation IV SMR to have such an agreement.
Regulatory approvals
Terrestrial commenced the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s Vendor Design Review process in early 2016 and successfully completed Phase 1 in late 2017, an industry first for an advanced nuclear power plant. It expects to complete Phase 2 by early 2022.
Last October the federal government announced a $20 million investment in Terrestrial to accelerate development of the IMSR. Terrestrial committed to creating and maintaining 186 jobs and creating 52 CO-OP positions nationally, as well as spending at least another $91.5 million in research and development.
In the U.S., Terrestrial Energy USA began working with Argonne National Laboratory in 2016 after receiving an award from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) program. GAIN directs investment to commercializing innovative nuclear technologies. IMSR pre-application U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission activities started in November 2018 with the support of U.S. DOE grant funding.
Growing worldwide demand for clean, reliable energy sources will drive demand for IMSR power plants, said Terrestrial, which said it is seeking to “deploy many hundreds of IMSR reactors over the next two decades. Furthermore, government policies that support emission-free power generation and industrial heat production can sharply accelerate deployment.”
Future evolution of IMSR technology could include use of spent nuclear fuel, “breeding” fuel cycles and even thorium fuel, the company said. “With these iterations, IMSR nuclear power becomes near-infinitely sustainable as an energy resource, one that can meet the majority of global energy needs for many centuries.”

The arrangement, which has the full support of the Syncrude joint venture owners and was initially announced in the fourth quarter of 2020, reflects Suncor’s confidence in the Syncrude asset and is part of a multi-year strategy to improve its operational performance, efficiency and competitiveness.
“In 2016 we acquired the interest of Canadian Oil Sands and since that time have continued to work with the other owners to find ways to capture increased value,” said Mark Little, Suncor president and chief executive officer. “Since the plan to assume operatorship was announced late last year, we’ve worked closely with the Syncrude team as well as the other joint venture owners to ensure a smooth transition of operatorship. Today marks a new chapter for the Syncrude project and by capitalizing on the collective strength of all of the Suncor-operated assets in the RMWB, we’ll work to improve operating performance and unlock significant value.”
In the RMWB, Suncor operates its Oil Sands Base Plant, in situ assets Firebag and McKay River, as well as joint venture assets Fort Hills Limited Partnership and Syncrude. Since 2016, Suncor has grown its ownership in Syncrude to 58.74 per cent from 12 per cent through acquisitions.

Force Majeure At Syncrude Adds To Crude Supply Woes | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Syncrude Canada Ltd., majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc., cut September supplies due to a mechanical disruption at its oilsands site, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
In a force majeure notice sent by one of Syncrude’s four owners earlier this month, customers were informed of a supply cut of as much as 20 per cent in September, the person said, asking not to be named because they are not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. Requests for comment to Suncor and fellow owners Imperial Oil Limited, Sinopec Canada and CNOOC Ltd. weren’t immediately returned. 
Syncrude’s upgrader, which turns mined bitumen into light synthetic crude, produced about 275,000 bbls/d between January and May, Alberta Energy Regulator data show. 
The supply cut out of Canada happens as oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been slow to recover from Hurricane Ida, which struck the Louisiana coast on Aug. 29 and forced the shut-in of most offshore production in the region. Almost 300,000 bbls/d of Gulf of Mexico crude output remains down due to the impact of the storm.

Martin King: Optimism Still Warranted For Canadian Heavy Crude Oil Pricing | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Canadian oil industry is on the cusp of the confirmation of additional oil flowing on the Enbridge Line 3 Replacement (L3R).
A longed-for physical increase in pipeline capacity to the U.S. Midwest and, more importantly, for the egress of Canadian crude oil barrels from Western Canada, the L3R represents the first major increase in physical pipeline takeaway capacity from Western Canada since the start-up of the Keystone Pipeline in 2010. It is also a transformational moment in that Canada’s oil industry will be in the pleasant position of having excess pipeline takeaway capacity with any sizeable magnitude for the first time since 2017.
RBN argued in Part 1 of this series that the completion of the start-up of the L3R represents an important fundamental shift in the pricing of Canadian crude oil, especially as this relates to the price spread between the Canadian heavy oil marker of Western Canada Select (WCS) and the North American light oil benchmark of WTI. By having excess pipeline takeaway capacity, heavy crude oil can now be priced at the margin more consistently with the cost of pipeline transportation, rather than facing additional price discounting for lack of pipeline space or to cover the higher transportation costs associated with the railing of crude oil to other markets.
Aside from the physical shift in takeaway capacity, Canadian crude oil is also in the enviable position of being a primary fallback for a U.S. market which is experiencing a steady, but wobbly, demand recovery from the COVID chaos of 2020 while dealing with its own domestic crude oil supplies, which are on a slow path to post-COVID recovery, creating more room for Canadian barrels. This has created ample opportunity for Canadian crude oil to be well priced in the near term into the major refining centers of the U.S. Midwest, Gulf Coast and Rockies. One unfortunate positive, if it can be called that, is that with U.S. Gulf Coast oil supplies still seeing a slow recovery from recent hurricane damage, prized sour and more heavy barrels from the Gulf of Mexico are in shorter supply, opening another avenue for Canadian heavy crude into the Gulf Coast and better pricing opportunities, although this will be for a limited time.
Most importantly, what the L3R does is buy some time for the Canadian oil industry. Time to capture not only attractive oil prices in the current environment, but also to capture additional revenue from increasing oil supplies into excess pipeline takeaway capacity. As we have argued, this excess should allow the heavy crude oil price spread to more closely approximate the cost of pipeline transportation, which we peg in the range of US$8 to US$11/bbl, depending on distance to U.S. markets.
What is also going to benefit Canadian barrels will be additional downstream access once these barrels arrive in the U.S. Midwest. Enbridge has been undertaking expansion on several of its U.S. pipelines that exit that region and flow southward to the Cushing hub and the Gulf Coast. Moreover, the pending reversal of Capline, a crude oil pipeline originally intended to move crude oil from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest, will begin its initial reversed operations in 2022. Additional reversed capacity will be brought onstream later next year and into 2023, including the ability to move heavier Canadian barrels. This should further improve access to the U.S. Gulf Coast and capture more market share for Canadian crudes.
Although pipeline transportation costs in an excess capacity scenario will act as anchor for the price spread, there are other factors to be considered. One of the most important is the cost of diluent, the light to super-light hydrocarbon that is mixed with heavy oil barrels that allow it to more easily flow in pipelines. The price of diluent is usually proxied by the cost of condensate at Edmonton, which is itself priced as a differential to WTI. Condensate typically trades on either side of WTI (small discount or premium), depending on the relative demand and supply availability of condensate in the Alberta market.
There is no doubt that the demand for condensate as diluent will be rising in the next few years. RBN estimates that demand for diluent, which is comprised primarily of condensate, will be rising from around 670,000 bbls/d currently to 730,000 bbls/d on average in 2022, a gain of 60,000 bbls/d. It’s no surprise in that we expect the 2022 demand for diluent will be at a record high as Canadian heavy crude oil production also reaches expected record-high volumes next year of 2.46 million bbls/d.

The Canadian domestic supply of diluent, best measured by the supply of condensate, has been somewhat slower to expand relative to its demand. Even with additional liquids-rich gas drilling anticipated for the remainder of this year and 2022, we believe the supply increase may be insufficient to keep up with demand. This should place increased demand on imported diluent that enters Alberta via the Cochin and Southern Lights pipelines. It is already the case that the combined diluent imports on these two pipelines have come close to testing the limits of their combined capacity. We suspect that both pipelines will be running very close to full for the balance of 2022, resulting in overall tight supplies for diluent.

Bearing in mind the supply and demand factors for diluent, it is no wonder that the price of condensate at Edmonton has shifted from a modest discount to a premium to WTI in recent months. We see this as reflecting what has become an increasingly tighter balance between diluent demand and supplies as heavy oil supplies have recovered and more barrels are set to flow into L3R. We anticipate that the price of condensate will shift to a larger premium in the coming months by as much as US$1 to US$2/bbl, placing it over WTI by US$3 to US$4/bbl. This higher cost for condensate forms an important component in settling on our outlook for the WCS-WTI price spread.

As we mentioned in Part 1, the arrival of excess pipeline capacity for the rest of this year and 2022 will, however, not fully eliminate the use of crude by rail (CBR) exports. Long-term contracts in place by companies such as Altex, and the recent start-up of the Gibson-USD railing terminal which rails concentrated bitumen to the U.S. Gulf Coast after recovering diluent for reuse in the Alberta market, could result in a steady flow of railed barrels for export in the range of 50 to 75,000 bbls/d, but lower than recent export levels. This lends a positive spin to our outlook for the WCS-WTI price spread by holding these barrels off the pipelines, effectively freeing pipeline capacity in the process.

In pulling together all of the elements that we have described, where does this point us in terms of an outlook for the WCS-WTI heavy oil price spread? As we described in Part 1, we have greater physical pipeline capacity to export barrels from Western Canada thanks to the L3R start up. U.S. demand is growing versus its own supplies, which are recovering more slowly. There also appears to be sufficient inventory capacity available in Alberta and further downstream in important U.S. hubs such as Cushing.
Factoring in what we believe will be some higher costs for the movement of heavy oil because of the increasing cost of diluent, we think the WCS-WTI price spread will hold under US$12/bbl for the remainder of 2021 and for the first half of 2022. This is above our pipeline transportation cost estimates of US$8 to $11/bbl, primarily because of the higher cost of condensate. Once we are past the midpoint of 2022, we believe that price spread could widen into the range of US$14/bbl. This will be driven by the same higher costs for diluent and what could be the approaching return of limited pipeline takeaway capacity as the industry’s supply push slowly exhausts all of the available space on L3R and other pipelines, forcing wider price spreads.

This outlook is very similar to the forward market’s current WCS-WTI price spreads for the remainder of 2021 and the first half of 2022, but is wider for the second half. Much remains to be seen in terms of how quickly oil supplies will fill available pipeline capacity. For the moment, the market is more optimistic in its assessment of the price spread than is RBN.
The market’s more optimistic assessment may be reflecting the view that another pipeline expansion will be making a timely appearance by the end of 2022 or early 2023: the Trans Mountain (TMX) pipeline expansion to the Canadian West Coast at Burnaby, B.C. Should this timing turn out to be correct, then TMX’s additional capacity of 590,000 bbls/d will provide ample takeaway capacity into the latter stages of this decade, despite the cancellation of the overly politicized Keystone XL pipeline. However, given the many obstacles and delays that TMX still faces before reaching completion, we feel it may be later in 2023 before it comes into service. As such, this would raise the scenario of limited pipeline takeaway again becoming a problem for the industry later in 2022, and to which we allude in our outlook for the heavy oil price spread.
In Part 2 of our November 2020 analysis of this topic, we stated that we see a long-term scenario in which the heavy price spread remains below US$16/bbl indefinitely. We now suggest it could be even tighter, under US$14/bbl, once the TMX expansion enters service as it will take several years for supplies to fill all available pipeline capacity, if even then. Keep in mind that efficiency improvements and the greater application of drag reducing agents can also add incremental takeaway capacity and could be worth up to an additional 150,000 bbls/d over the next few years, over and above the capacity expansions brought into service by L3R and TMX. As such, the WCS-WTI price spread should continue to be anchored much closer to the pipeline cost of transportation, rather than face any serious additional discounting as has been the case so many times in the past when pipeline takeaway capacity was in short supply.
All in, the arrival of additional pipeline capacity with the start-up of L3R and other market developments since 2020 have finally placed the Canadian crude oil industry on a much more favourable path going forward. Putting aside the usual unpredictable nature of global crude oil prices, the outlook for the pricing of Canadian heavy crude oil in relation to benchmarks such as WTI is looking more secure than it has for many years.

Martin King: Increasingly Positive Fundamentals Aligning For Canadian Heavy Crude Oil | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Part 2 of this series is available at this link: Martin King: Optimism Still Warranted For Canadian Heavy Crude Oil Pricing

It has been nearly a year since RBN last offered up its assessment on the pricing prospects for Canadian heavy crude oil.
Needless to say, the Canadian and global crude oil markets have evolved a great deal in that time, and, by nearly all measures, the trends have been positive for demand, supplies, inventories, and prices.
Before digging deeper into the current and expected fundamentals of the heavy oil market, let’s review how we did in our previous pricing outlook. In that outlook we chose to focus on the price spread between the Canadian heavy oil price benchmark of Western Canada Select (WCS) and the North American light crude oil benchmark, WTI. In short, when the heavy oil market is not burdened with undue constraints and is readily able to find buyers, the price discount of WCS to WTI (WCS price less WTI price) tends to be narrower. Conversely, the more the market runs up against constraints and struggles to find buyers, the wider the price discount.
 With 75 per cent of Western Canada’s crude oil production being in the form of conventional heavy oil, bitumen, or upgraded bitumen, strong relative pricing prospects (smaller discounts) for heavy oil are critical in keeping the industry in a healthy economic position.
We had expected the WCS-WTI price spread to hold between US$10 and US$13 per barrel for 4Q20 to 2Q21, inclusive, with some widening to US$15-US$16 per barrel by the end of this year. As it turns out, our price spread assessment for 4Q20 to 2Q21 was very close, but we proved to be too pessimistic (the actual price spread was narrower than our assessment) for 3Q21. The current forward pricing curve for this spread in 4Q21 is also more optimistic than our prior assessment. Overall, our outlook turned out to be relatively accurate, with a good portion of it coming to pass for the end of 2020 and the first half of 2021.
As for how price spreads for the rest of 2021 and the balance of 2022 will shake out, we think market fundamentals have been evolving in such a fashion that continued optimism (narrow WCS price spreads) is still warranted. It could be argued that the Canadian heavy oil market, and the Canadian oil industry in general, is positioned in the next 15 months for some of the most price conducive market conditions since the middle years of the prior decade.

Let’s first consider the supply situation. Heavy crude oil supplies in Western Canada have more than fully recovered from the price crash caused by the brief Saudi-Russia price war and the COVID demand downturn of 2020, as well as some intensive turnarounds this past spring, now standing near the highest levels on record. Based on outlooks provided by the major oilsands producers and conventional crude oil players, Canadian heavy crude oil supplies should be pushing to new records later this year and in 2022 beyond 2.5 million barrels/d.
In contrast, crude oil supplies in the U.S. have not fully recovered from the price war and COVID disruptions of last year and have been further rocked by extensive disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico in recent weeks as a result of Hurricane Ida. The most recent outlook for U.S. crude oil supplies from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggests that further supply recovery will be a gradual affair, and are still expected to remain below the 2019 peak up to the end of 2022; the supply recovery trend may even end up being lower than what the EIA has forecast due to what appears to be longer lasting negative production impacts in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Ida. Simply put, this keeps the door open for additional Canadian crude oil into the U.S. market with less direct competition from U.S. domestic supplies.

The demand side of the equation has improved much faster than what we expected last year. When considering the refinery run situation for U.S. PADDs 2 (Midwest), 3 (Gulf Coast) and 4 (Rockies), the destination for 98 per cent of Canadian crude oil exports, runs recovered sharply this spring as demand and mobility increased across the U.S., firming up the demand for refined products such as gasoline.
Putting aside the deep freeze of February and the downturn due to hurricane impacts that have lasted well into September for the Gulf Coast, refining trends have been generally positive in all three regions, although likely to fall seasonally as we exit the summer driving season. Most U.S. states have remained largely open despite concerns over COVID variants, suggesting that consumer demand for refined products can remain on a positive path to recovery, though driving and domestic air travel trends remain shaky.
However, the current demand outlook from the EIA has total U.S. consumption returning to record levels by 2022. This may get an additional boost in coming months if the U.S. follows through on announced plans to resume international air travel with most major overseas nations after October. Jet fuel demand has been the only significant refined product laggard in the U.S. market, primarily as a result of curtailed overseas travel, so any chance for additional improvement only adds to what is an already positive demand picture.

With effectively all incremental increases in Canadian crude oil supplies, mostly heavy barrels, destined for export to the U.S., this further underscores the positive alignment of fundamentals for Canada: more supply and more exports into a U.S. market that is experiencing growing demand against a slower recovery in its own supplies. Further, consider that most of the expected U.S. supply increase will be lighter barrels and destined for export, rather than the heavy sour barrels preferred by PADDs 2, 3 and 4 refiners, and the situation for Canadian heavy oil barrels looks even brighter for the rest of this year and next year.
So far, both the supply and demand side for Canadian crude oil, and heavy oil in particular, is looking very promising. The balancing point between these two most fundamental of indicators is the level of inventories, which can have an influential role in the heavy oil price spread. The two regions of concern for Canadian crude are Alberta and U.S. PADD 2 (Midwest).
In contrast to our thinking that we described last year, Alberta’s oil inventories quickly began to rise late in 2020 on the back of supply increases and have subsequently pushed to and above the five-year historic range near 75 million barrels based on data from the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). What is noteworthy is that this strong increase did not result in any overt pressure for a widening of the WCS-WTI price spread during this time. We think that increases in total available inventory capacity in Alberta over the past year have helped to alleviate some of the pricing pressures from inventories that might have been deemed “too full” in prior years. There are anecdotal indications that these inventories have been pulled lower in August and September.

Returning to inventory levels in PADD 2, the primary storage region for Canadian barrels imported into the U.S., these are at the low end of the five-year range. As more crude begins to flow from Canada with its increases in supply, there is more room to store these barrels in the Midwest, further reducing the likelihood of a widening of the heavy oil price spread.
So far, we have seen record and rising Canadian crude supplies in contrast to a slow supply recovery in the U.S., and solid indications that U.S. demand is going to recover further and faster, incentivizing more intake of Canadian barrels into U.S. refineries. Furthermore, the inventory situation on both sides of the border is certainly not tight by historical standards given the additional inventory capacity available in Alberta this year compared with prior years.
This leaves us to consider what we think is the most important fundamental shift for the Canadian crude oil market in several years and one that underscores our positive assessment for heavy crude oil price spreads: a substantial increase in combined domestic uptake and takeaway capacity for crude oil from Western Canada.
We have compiled all of the available outlets for Canadian crude oil, covering domestic uptake in the form of Western Canadian refining demand (WCSB Demand), crude by rail (CBR) exports, and all pipeline corridors that exit the region. Though there have been numerous optimizations undertaken on several pipelines, as well as the application of drag reducing agents (DRAs) which allow more crude to flow for a given pipeline capacity, the most important structural increase in physical pipeline takeaway capacity is the impending start-up of the completed Enbridge Line 3 Replacement (L3R; green region) in October.

There have been other modest incremental capacity gains taking place due to the aforementioned optimizations and DRAs, but these have primarily only kept pace with the expansion in crude oil supplies in recent years. The start-up of L3R in October, the Canadian side of which was complete last year, should push total WCSB demand and takeaway capacity by pipeline and rail a point in excess of current and near-term expectations for Canadian crude oil supplies. This would be a situation last enjoyed by the Western Canadian crude market in late 2017. There will also still be some rail exports of crude taking place due to fixed long-term contracts in place by a number of suppliers, effectively freeing up additional space on the pipelines that could be used by these exports.
The L3R nameplate expansion is pegged at 370,000 barrels/d, although the increase in the physical flow of barrels will be more in the range of 230,000 barrels/d based on part of the capacity on the Canadian side of L3R being filled last year, prior to the completion of the U.S. portion. Nevertheless, L3R represents the first expansion of size for Western Canada pipeline takeaway capacity since the start-up of the Keystone pipeline in 2010.
The vital by-product of the L3R activation is that because it creates excess in pipeline takeaway capacity, crude oil price spreads can now fully and consistently reflect the inherent transportation costs for all pipelines between Western Canada and other regions in the U.S. and Canada. There is less chance of Canadian oil supplies having to be discounted in a competition to find buyers through apportioned pipeline capacity or to incentivize the incremental use of rail for transportation. As such, we estimate that the implicit cost of moving barrels by pipeline is in the US$8 to US$11/bbl, and should act as anchor for the near-term determination of the heavy oil price spread.
In the second and concluding part of this analysis, we will bring together all these elements to present RBN’s outlook for the WCS-WTI price spread to the end of 2022.

"Initial Agreement Between B.C., Blueberry River First Nations Is ‘Clearly Good News,’ Says EPAC President | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
The president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) says yesterday’s announcement that Blueberry River First Nations and the B.C. government have reached an initial agreement is a positive step forward for all involved.
“This is clearly good news for B.C. natural gas development, B.C. Indigenous nations and all B.C. workers,” Tristan Goodman said in a statement.
“I have confidence that building on this positive momentum we will reach a new place for everyone involved that can obtain better results on cumulative impacts, protect Indigenous rights and allow our industry to develop B.C.’s clean natural gas resources that the world so desperately needs. It’s a good day.”
As part of the agreement, 195 forestry and oil and gas projects, which were permitted or authorized prior to the court decision and where activities have not yet started, will proceed. Twenty currently approved authorizations, which relate to development activities in areas of high cultural importance, will not proceed without further negotiation and agreement from Blueberry. The province has provided notification to the respective permit holders.
A spokesperson for the B.C. Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation said that of the 20 affected authorizations/permits that were previously approved but not part of this agreement, 12 were oil and gas-related permits while the other eight were forestry.
“All affected permit holders have been notified,” the spokesperson said.
Brad Herald, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers’ vice-president of Western Canada operations, said the oil and gas industry “welcomes the clarity” provided on existing approved authorizations outlined in the agreement between Blueberry River First Nations and the Province of British Columbia.
“This is an important initial step for the work to come with the engagement process and development of interim and long-term approaches for reviewing authorizations of new natural resource activities,” he said.
“We believe our partnerships with Indigenous communities and businesses support economic reconciliation; a key part of Canada’s overall approach to reconciliation.”
As reported in the DOB, no new wells were approved in B.C. in August, as the province continues to work with the BRFN on a way to improve and modernize provincial processes that recognize and respect their treaty rights.
Earlier this summer, the B.C. Supreme Court found the provincial government breached the Treaty 8 agreement signed with the BRFN because it allowed development such as forestry and natural gas extraction without the community’s approval.
Agreement detail
Blueberry River First Nations and the B.C. government reached an initial agreement, announced Thursday afternoon, “that begins to support healing the land, and helps provide stability and certainty for forestry and oil and gas permit holders in Blueberry’s traditional territory in the immediate term,” the province announced today.
The agreement follows the historic June 29, 2021, B.C. Supreme Court ruling in Blueberry River First Nations (Yahey) v. Province of British Columbia, which determined the Treaty 8 rights of the Blueberry River First Nations have been breached by development authorized by the provincial government over many years.
The initial agreement is a first step in responding to the B.C. Supreme Court’s decision, which requires the province and Blueberry to work together to develop land management processes in Blueberry territory that restore and protect the ability of the land to support Indigenous ways of life, and ensure future development authorizations manage cumulative effects on land and wildlife and their impact on the Nation’s treaty rights.
Under the agreement, the province will establish a $35-million fund for Blueberry to undertake activities to heal the land, creating jobs for Nation members and business for service providers in the northeast region. Activities will include:

land, road and seismic restoration;
river, stream and wetland restoration;
habitat connectivity;
native seed and nursery projects; and,
training for restoration activities.

In addition, $30 million will be allocated to support the Blueberry River First Nations in protecting their Indigenous way of life. Activities will include:

work on cultural areas, traplines, cabins and trails;
educational activities and materials, including teaching traditional skills and language;
expanding Blueberry River resources and capacity for land management; and,
restoring the health of wildlife through wildlife management, habitat enhancement including prescribed burning, and research.

The province and Blueberry are now working to finalize an interim approach for reviewing new natural resource activities that balance Treaty 8 rights, the economy and the environment.
Once an interim approach is in place, the negotiation teams will work to reach long-term solutions that protect Treaty 8 rights and an Indigenous way of life. They will explore establishing areas for protection and developing ecosystem-based management systems to incorporate cumulative impacts into decision-making.
The solutions will work to reset the balance promised in Treaty 8, ensuring environmental sustainability, protection of Treaty 8 rights and Indigenous culture, and stable economic activity and employment.
The province is starting dialogue with the other Treaty 8 Nations on matters of treaty rights, including advancing new environmental restoration work across Treaty 8 territory and ensuring all Treaty 8 Nations are part of the development of a new approach to how natural resource activity is planned and authorized in the territory.
The province and Blueberry will provide regular updates to, and seek input from, Blueberry members, industry, local governments and residents of the northeast as negotiations proceed.

Scientists Look To Tap Into World’s Biggest Carbon Sink Off B.C. Coast | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Scientists have moved one step closer to tapping into vast coastal undersea basalts with the potential to contain, and turn into rock, all the carbon emitted into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began — and then some.
The B.C.-based Solid Carbon negative emissions project, operated by the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS), aims to build offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities that would extract CO2 from air and pump it into subsea basalts below sedimentary strata where it would mineralize over time for permanent removal from the atmosphere.
A study published by the University of Calgary has shown that gigatonne-scale carbon dioxide storage is possible without the type of rigorous controls hampering existing projects, like the world’s largest negative emissions plant recently started in Iceland, primarily by eliminating the onerous extra step of dissolving captured CO2 in water before injection.
The Iceland facility — known as Orca for the Icelandic orka, meaning energy — sees the dissolved CO2 react chemically downhole and mineralize into rock in less than two years. The ground-breaking plant combines direct air capture (DAC) technology developed by Swiss-based Climeworks AG with Icelandic start-up Carbfix’s sequestration technology to sell negative emissions credits. But its need to dissolve CO2 in water limits its scalability.
The Solid Carbon concept simply injects compressed (supercritical) CO2 downhole. While it takes much longer to mineralize, that is irrelevant when pumping into impenetrable subsea aquifers. “What we showed is that it's less efficient [at mineralization], but it still works,” said geoscience associate professor Benjamin Tutolo, lead author of the study. “It would take longer, but it is more scalable.”
In Iceland, the pore space that's most accessible in the basalts is fairly shallow, explained Tutolo. “So if they injected it as just a gas it would come right back up. So they have to inject it as a dissolve phase in order to make sure it doesn't come right back up.”
“For them, they need approximately 30 to 35 tonnes of water for every tonne of CO2 [sequestered], whereas we just inject CO2. So it's a pore space problem — 35 tonnes of water is a lot of water,” per tonne of CO2 removed.
When CO2 is injected into porous basalt aquifers, the gas reacts with minerals in the rock to form solid, stable carbonates in a process known as basalt carbonation. What the Solid Carbon study shows is that time is not an issue for offshore storage, since leakage is not an issue.
“The reaction needn’t be completed in days or even months as long as the CO2 doesn’t escape before the process is complete, even if it takes centuries,” he said, since offshore aquifers are typically topped with 300-800 metres of impermeable sediment, and residence times of water in these aquifers are inferred to be on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of years.
While potentially providing a massive geological store for carbon, Solid Carbon’s solution could be up to two decades of study away from commercialization. “We're trying to demonstrate that it can work now and then ideally by 2040, we can bring down the various costs enough so that it's economical,” Tutolo said in an interview.
“The ultimate goal is to make it in line with carbon pricing. So Canada's [$170 carbon price], that's what we're shooting for. And that's doable, provided there are decreases in the cost of direct air capture technology, which is by far the most expensive part right now.”
The technology can also work for conventional CCS type operations where CO2 is captured at a point source, like a power plant or hydrogen production facility. “But in order to do negative emissions, which is the ultimate goal here, then we need to do direct air capture.”
The UCalgary study, Alkalinity Generation Constraints on Basalt Carbonation for Carbon Dioxide Removal at the Gigaton-per-year Scale, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology in August, is based on a series of geochemical and thermodynamic calculations and basalt dissolution simulations. The UCalgary scientists demonstrate that gigatonne-scale storage is possible when plumes of captured CO2 are directly injected into deep ocean basalt, where the CO2 reacts with minerals and, over time, forms a solid carbonate rock.
As a supercritical fluid, CO2 retains the flow properties of a gas but the density and space filling properties of a liquid. “Held under an impermeable ‘lid’ of sediment, over time it dissolves into reservoir water and triggers basalt dissolution, yielding minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron silicates) which bind with the CO2, forming solid carbonate minerals (rock) which cannot escape from the reservoir,” the PICS website explains.
Genesis of the project
The project dates back to a 2017 pre-feasibility study called CarbonSafe, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and led by Columbia University, conducted to evaluate the technical and nontechnical aspects of sequestering 50 million tonnes of CO2 in a safe, ocean basalt reservoir offshore B.C. and Washington State.
Building on CarbonSafe, the Solid Carbon project launched a four-year feasibility study in 2019 led by Ocean Networks Canada, a UVic initiative, and funder and partner PICS involving researchers from Canada, the United States and Europe.
Scientists are currently investigating systems engineering of floating offshore platforms that will house DAC technology, injection equipment and alternative systems powered by scalable renewable power, design and development of a carbon mineralization demonstration plan, and research on social, investor and regulatory acceptance of the Solid Carbon concept.
Intensively studied Cascadia Basin ideal site
The Cascadia Basin off the coast of Vancouver Island, situated on the Juan de Fuca Plate that stretches to the north California coast, provides the ideal test bed for the Solid Carbon, said Tutolo. Findings there can be extrapolated to vast swathes of the world’s coastlines.
The extensively studied basin potentially combines an area with high wind energy capacity with sub-seabed geologic formations suitable for storing carbon dioxide. Since 90 per cent of the world’s basalt is beneath the ocean floor, Solid Carbon figures it would be globally scalable at different locations where ocean basalt occurs, opening up a virtually unlimited storage capacity.
Cascadia Basin alone has the potential to store up to 20 years of total global CO2 emissions, Solid Carbon estimates. So enormous are the basalts worldwide that it is estimated their pore space could contain 100,000-250,000 gigatonnes of CO2, “which is more CO2 than will be produced by burning all of the fossil fuels on the planet today,” notes Tutolo.
 “The reason that we've chosen that location is because it is the very best studied basaltic aquifer in the world, and happens to be just off the coast of Canada. But basalt covers all of the ocean basins — [it] is formed in the Earth's mid ocean ridges, and is therefore covering on the order of 50 to 70 per cent of our planet.”
The basin is home to the NEPTUNE (North-East Pacific Time-series Undersea Networked Experiments) ocean observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada, which consists of six interconnected ocean floor research modules up to 2,200 metres deep spread out over 800 kilometres. It has been monitoring aspects of the sediment-covered crust of volcanic rock underlying the basin, like water chemistry and geological and ecological data, in real time since 2009.
“They have fibre optic cables going out to the Cascadia Basin [and] they already have seismometers, they already have wells drilled out there — scientific monitoring wells that we can then repurpose to test our technology,” Tutolo said.
Though the Juan de Fuca Plate underlying the basin is known to slip along the Cascadia subduction zone resulting in megathrust earthquakes, the researchers are confident injecting CO2 would not create any quake risk.
“As far as we can tell, and I think most oil and gas folks would say the same thing, [is] that the permeability of these aquifers are so high that injecting additional CO2 is not going to trigger microseismicity, essentially. So the pressure that we generate, the overpressure that comes with injecting CO2, will be dissipated quickly enough, and you aren't going to cause the rocks to fail.”
Next steps
Building on the work published in the UCalgary study, Solid Carbon researchers are studying further aspects of large-scale CO2 injection into oceanic basalts, while examining ocean system designs and efficient well injection strategies, including the possibility of technologies such as water-alternating-gas injection to speed up mineralization.
The work is leading up to planned pilot-scale CO2 injection in 2024 followed by prototype and manufacturing process design to 2030 and wide-scale deployment after 2040.
Developing monitoring technology is also a priority, even if leakage is considered to be a long shot, said Tutolo. “How do we prove that the CO2 is doing what we think it's doing? How do we prove that we've injected it, it's staying there and it's mineralizing, essentially? So one of the things we've been working on a lot is the technology for monitoring the CO2 in the subsurface.
“I'm extraordinarily confident it will stay there,” he emphasized. “We have every reason to believe it will. There's a very impermeable sediment later laying the top of the basalts, and then of course, in the extremely unlikely circumstance that it did leak from the basalt, that it would be in two and a half kilometres depth of seawater. [There are] lots of opportunities to dissolve and disperse itself from there.
“But we know from studies of the water that's in these aquifers that that water stays there for quite a long time and doesn't see the ocean during that period of time.”
O&G expertise
Of course, much of the technology derives from the oil and gas industry, Tutolo told the DOB. “I think one of the things that's been most exciting to us, and we have had collaborators from the oil and gas industry, is that we're basically piggybacking on decades of R&D from the offshore oil and gas industry. They figured out how to drill these wells, they figured out how to inject and produce fluid from these types of wells, so we're able to piggyback on all of that expertise, and essentially retool it for a climate change solution.”
Solid Carbon has been in discussions with “several major players,” he added, though it’s too early to name them. “They come to our quarterly meetings to discuss things. They're what we call ‘solution seekers’ and we're always looking for more solution seekers — those folks that have a problem that perhaps our technology can solve.”
As for collaboration in general, “the more the merrier,” Tutolo said. “Everyone really wants to see this work rather than outcompete one another, although I understand there is money to be made at some point.” In fact, he added, “I think this is a problem that's going to launch 1,000 or a million start-ups. I think business is good right now for startups in this industry.”
Solid Carbon has also drawn one of the few DAC companies, Squamish, B.C.-based Carbon Engineering Ltd., into regular discussions, describing it as “a world-leading commercial company for direct air capture.” Carbon Engineering developed a working prototype that can capture about 300 tonnes per year and is working with Occidental Petroleum Corporation to construct a DAC plant to capture one million tonnes of CO2 annually for enhanced oil recovery in Texas.
 Solid Carbon’s integrated system would see CO2 extracted from the atmosphere through DAC technology installed on an ocean floating platform, powered by wind, solar and/or thermal energy. A key design challenge will be adapting DAC technology that has only been used on land to perform reliably on a floating offshore ocean platform that is powered by renewables, said Curran Crawford, a professor with UVic’s Institute for Integrated Energy Systems.
Current DAC technologies, which use liquid chemical solutions or solid sorbent filters to capture CO2 from the air, are highly energy intensive. They must be powered by clean energy sources to achieve negative emissions.
“Another challenge is that the basalt reservoirs we want to reach are 2,700 metres deep, so our team is engaging with offshore oil and gas drilling experts who have successfully built systems in the deep-sea environment,” Crawford stated.
Negative emissions interest
The small group of companies that have announced plans to purchase negative emissions to compensate for previous or hard to abate emissions, and are willing to pay large sums to jumpstart the sector, like Microsoft, Stripe Inc. and Shopify Inc., have also shown an interest. But the technology is not yet advanced enough for them to make investments, Tutolo said.
“It's a very hot topic right now. And so what we are trying to do is get in at sort of the leading edge of these things,” he said. “We haven't had a pilot scale operation, so it's not at a technology readiness level required of some of those organizations, but it is getting there. And I think our ultimate goal is hopefully to get enough funding right now, within the next couple of years, to prove that it works, using a pilot scale operation, and then we'll be at the readiness level required for a lot of those funding opportunities.”
Enough funding to pilot the technology is considered to be $30-$60 million, he said. Funding currently comes primarily from PICS, which is hosted and led by UVic in collaboration with the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University and the University of Northern British Columbia. “They put money into this project essentially with the goal of starting us out and getting us going, so that we can then raise more money to keep moving.”
Scale-up to meaningful levels of capture could be a major challenge as well. Climeworks’s geothermal powered Orca project sequesters just 4,000 tonnes per year, a miniscule percentage of the 51 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of GHGs dumped into the atmosphere by human activity each year.
The scale of the challenge has become apparent to Climeworks, which charges between $600 and $1,200 per tonne of CO2 captured and is counting on decreasing that to as low as $200 by 2030. It has downgraded its original ambition to sequester one per cent of CO2 emissions, or more than 300 million tonnes, by 2025 to its new target of just 500,000 tonnes annually by 2030.
Not an alternative to net zero
To be sure, the technology in no way reduces the need to rapidly decarbonize the economy. Both net zero and negative emissions will be required to meet emissions mitigation goals.
Already too late to rely on deep emissions reductions alone to meet climate targets, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report found that the future of a livable planet now relies in part on removing anywhere from 100 billion to one trillion tonnes of CO2 already in the atmosphere this century, depending on how much more the emissions budget is overdrawn in the coming decades.
“Human-caused GHG emissions are driving us toward tipping points at which dire consequences of climate change will be inevitable,” Tutolo said.
Or, as PICS executive director Sybil Seitzinger put it: “Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are not enough — we need large-scale, permanent removal of excess carbon from the atmosphere.”
The world will need these potentially game-changing technologies in the climate-action toolbox, Seitzinger said. “Negative emissions technologies such as Solid Carbon do not replace the need for urgent emissions reductions but are needed alongside deep decarbonization if we are to limit average global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.”
In fact, projects like Solid Carbon could put Canada in the forefront of a new sector set to blossom over the next few decades. A successful technology demonstration would set the stage for rapid commercialization and global mass-scale deployment needed for permanent CO2 removal, says Solid Carbon’s website. “The success of Solid Carbon will also position Canada as a leader in international climate mitigation technology.”
The next decade will see carbon removal become a mainstream industry and a global economic opportunity, it says, predicting CCS could become a $2 trillion industry by 2050. “By leveraging the federal government’s 15-year investment in Ocean Networks Canada’s infrastructure, Canada is uniquely positioned to take the lead in this evolving, but rapidly growing industry.”

"Modular Nuclear Reactors Touted For Saskatchewan Grid, Oilsands Extraction | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
If Ontario Power Generation (OPG), SaskPower and TC Energy Corporation have their way, a next generation nuclear power plant — whose developer is to be chosen this fall — will reach criticality near Toronto in seven years, followed by a fleet of four identical small modular reactors (SMRs) firing up in Saskatchewan through the 2030s.
That’s the plan mapped out in a strategy document, Feasibility of Small Modular Reactor Development and Deployment in Canada, prepared by OPG, SaskPower, TC Energy subsidiary Bruce Power and New Brunswick Power.
It is one of three nuclear power streams enunciated in the report published in March. The other two look at micro SMRs for off-grid development and nuclear waste-consuming SMRs planned for the East Coast.
Last October, OPG announced it is advancing engineering and design work with three grid-scale SMR developers: Terrestrial Energy Inc., GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and X-energy (whose technologies will be featured in future stories in this series). The utilities are reviewing all three to determine which can best meet Stream 1 requirements with regards to technology readiness, economics and potential for Canadian content, with a final technology selection planned to be made at the end of 2021.
While not directly addressed in the report (Alberta had not yet joined the other provinces in the nuclear collation when the report was commissioned), Calgary-based TC Energy sees the development plan as a springboard to bring SMRs to Alberta.
“We look forward to being a very fast second-mover in this technology,” said Wendell Klassen, director, Market Services & Compliance, with TC Energy, which owns 48 per cent of Bruce Power, operator of eight CANDU reactors on Lake Huron that represent Canada’s largest nuclear power station. “We are extremely bullish as it relates to SMRs and the new technology” under development, he told an Alberta Innovates Small Modular Reactor Learning Series virtual webinar.
“It's just starting to come into light now, which is extremely encouraging. And I suppose the reason why we are so bullish on SMRs, [and] I'm excited to see where this is going to go, [is] because we are one of those independent power producers who have been involved in Alberta for 20-plus years, specifically on the cogeneration side, where our current cogeneration facilities —  we actually utilize the existing heat from our gas plants to produce electricity —  but we also use that and sell that steam to our hosts for multiple different in situ and gas fractionation [facilities], and fertilizer production and those types of things.
“And that's one of the things that we're super excited about as it relates to SMRs, because not only are SMRs emission free, in terms of their electricity generation, but they also, depending on the technology, can produce an excessive amount of heat, which would facilitate these processes that we're mentioning. So we see a great future for SMRs in Alberta for sure as it relates to the production piece,” Klassen said.
John Gorman, president and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Association, said SMRs are a good fit for Alberta’s oilsands. “There are very active discussions going on right now between the nuclear industry and the oilsands industries,” he told the Alberta Innovates webinar.
“I think Alberta Innovates is playing an important role here, but COSIA [Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance] in particular is working with our industry, going over the technical requirements now and looking at some of the market requirements et cetera. And so I expect that the oilsands is going to be one of the very first sectors that is going to see these small modular reactors deployed, and I would think with some volume. So we would be looking I imagine towards the end of this decade to see some of those units placed in the oilsands and there is huge potential there,” Gorman said.
Strategic plan
All designs under consideration have their vendor design reviews with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission underway. The chosen nuclear technology company will deploy its first reactor at OPG’s Darlington nuclear generating station on Lake Ontario, targeting first power by 2028. Darlington is home to four operating CANDU reactors undergoing refurbishment this decade that will extend their operation into the 2060s. (Older CANDU reactors at Pickering are set to shut down in 2025.)
Site approvals are already in place at the Darlington site because it was originally intended as the site of CANDU expansion, a plan that was ultimately abandoned a decade ago amid skyrocketing costs. The pre-approval status of the site makes it “a vital strategic asset,” said the report, speeding development of the new fleet of reactors to be sited in Saskatchewan and elsewhere. It also leverages the expertise and existing infrastructure of the two Ontario-based nuclear operators, OPG and Bruce Power.
“Taking advantage of the ‘shovel ready’ status of the licensed nuclear site at Darlington would confirm Canada’s first mover advantage and support the next phase of the Stream 1 SMR development in Saskatchewan to support its electricity decarbonization plans with the potential for SMR deployment in the early 2030s.”
In fact, the willingness to consider a first-of-its-kind reactor at the site and the ability to get started now has attracted interest from a number of SMR developers. “Work is underway to move forward with a fleet of grid-scale SMRs with technologies that are ready to deploy thus enabling a clean and innovative energy option,” states the report.
About three-quarters of Saskatchewan’s electricity is supplied by coal and natural gas. The federal government wants to phase out coal nation-wide by 2030. Meeting its needs for energy while enabling decarbonization requires new low-carbon generation from the first SMR to be available as early as 2032, said the report. “This can be followed by a fleet of similar units about every three years to 2042 to continue the province’s move away from fossil generation.”
Deciding on a first nuclear plant is a big decision for a non-nuclear jurisdiction, it said. While Saskatchewan is home to the world’s highest-grade uranium ore and best known non-government owned uranium mining company, it currently has no nuclear generation.
 “As part of its plan to introduce nuclear generation and to mitigate its risk of going forward with this new technology, it would like to benefit from the vast expertise already available in other parts of Canada, in Ontario and New Brunswick, by companies who have been operating nuclear plants for decades.”
Nuclear disruption
The global nuclear industry is working to disrupt the market with the development of SMRs, according to the report, with the objective to simplify designs, reduce overall capital requirements and enable shorter project construction times that SMRs can provide. “Traditional economies of scale are to be overcome through the economies of numbers, where large fleets of standard plants should give rise to lower costs in both capital and operation.”
The use of factory build, repeating the same tasks in a controlled environment for a large fleet of reactors, will drive further cost reduction attributed to learning.
Lower upfront costs means they can access markets not previously open to conventional nuclear power, while proximity to the customer and higher operating temperatures provided by next generation technologies opens the possibility of providing both heat and power. SMRs will target not only traditional on-grid electricity generation to replace fossil fuels as the fuel of choice, but also the needs of heavy industry, mining and the fossil fuel industry.
“SMRs can play a critical role in reducing the emissions intensity of resource projects such as oilsands and natural gas, thus enabling continued development of those critical sectors,” notes the report.
Additional potential benefits for Canada include creation of a new industrial sub-sector, anchoring cutting-edge research in Canada and putting Canada at the centre of a global export market, global leadership in SMR policy expertise, unlocking regional growth opportunities and helping Canada meet its climate change commitments.
The capital cost of the first SMR sited in Ontario is expected to be less than $3 billion.
Ontario’s system operator’s high growth scenario further supports implementing an SMR as a means to decarbonize power production as demand increases in that province. “This will also ensure that the Ontario-based operators will be in a good position to deploy further units should decisions be taken to increase electrification of transport and home heating in the years ahead to meet carbon net zero targets by 2050.”
Government support
There is an essential role for governments to play in supporting SMR success, the report said, recommending that the federal and provincial governments interested in SMRs provide funding to cost share with industry in one or more SMR demonstration projects for advanced reactor designs. Governments should also implement measures to share risk with private investors to incentivize first commercial deployment of SMRs in Canada, with the potential of exporting SMR technologies and innovations developed in Canada to international markets.
Further policy action is also needed at a more detailed level to ensure regulatory processes in place to support SMR development are not a barrier for SMR development and licensing. There are still some regulatory and procedural changes necessary to recognize the lower inherent risk and safety of SMRs, the report found.
For example, once an SMR is licensed and operational, the licensing of subsequent units should be significantly more efficient provided there are no design changes. That would provide investors and operators the certainty necessary to move forward with a fleet approach which is necessary to make the business case for SMRs.
“Again, this is an area where Canada can be a world leader. One of the advantages Canada is generally seen to have in the effort to become a world leader in SMR development is a regulatory process that is more safety goal oriented than rule based.”
But the real measure of government support for SMR development would be making funding available for needed activities, the report found, including a four-year funding commitment to support licensing of the new technology to be deployed as part of Stream 1 and a five-year funding commitment matched by SaskPower to support site selection, SMR vendor selection, development of site and construction license applications, impact assessment and engagement required to support SMR deployment in Saskatchewan.
The benefits can be substantial, the report noted. A study undertaken for Ontario and Saskatchewan by the Conference Board of Canada assessed the economic benefits for Canada from a single reactor in Ontario and four units in Saskatchewan over their lifetime. It found the direct, indirect and induced employment on an average annual basis would amount to 1,528 jobs during project development, 12,455 jobs during manufacturing and construction and 1,469 jobs during operations.
It would have a positive impact on GDP (direct, indirect and induced) of $17 billion and provide an increase in government revenue of $5.4 billion. An SMR sector would also create new growth and export opportunities for Canada’s nuclear companies.
“SMRs represent an opportunity for Canada to be part of the next phase of global nuclear development,” concludes the report. “Canada is in an ideal position to take the lead in SMR development and deployment.”
SMR fit for Alberta
Though SMRs remain years away from mass deployment, Klassen said the time is right to lay the groundwork for their deployment. “We're excited to get into this world [and] time quickly can pass, and so we want to make sure that we have both feet on the ground, not only as a company, but also as a province, to ensure that the right processes are in place so that this investment can come through.”
Nuclear power can offer a complement to clean renewable power, rather than a substitute for it as the provinces decarbonize, he said. “We feel that it has such a great value as it relates to the fill-in for the renewable sector. Obviously, the renewable generation is critical, and the moving forward as it relates to the Alberta initiatives for net zero [emissions] in the future.
“What small modular reactors do [is to] fill in the gap for the times where the renewable power are not able to generate, and so not only is it emission free, but it also fills a very unique void that very, very few generators can actually fulfill. And this [SMR] type of nuclear we feel is a great fit for the industry and specifically for Alberta.”
Alberta’s deregulated market offers another advantage, he said. “It has been proven to be extremely successful with respect to the additional generation that's come on and the needs that are required by Albertans —  so that would include residential and commercial, and industrial and all of the loads that are required.
“So then there is a process in place. There also is a market that's functioning extremely well. And the regulations and the permitting, and all of those types of things that the government is responsible for, is going to be what's critical as it relates to the future of SMR development within Alberta, to ensure that the process is made, so that these types of things can be done… When the right signals are in place, then the correct investment will be soon to follow.”
SMRs are “a very logical opportunity for Alberta to engage in,” Cameron Brown, former director, Environment and Technology Integration at Alberta Energy, told the Alberta Innovates webinar series in March. While it would have to be driven by private investors, given Alberta’s deregulated market, he said the province can make the preparations today. “There's two ways the province could tackle that; we can sit back and wait and assume that everything's figured out, or we can proactively begin to start understanding these technologies and think about how regulatory regimes would interact with each other. And obviously, Alberta is choosing the more proactive route.” he told the webinar.
“It's ultimately going to be private investors in Alberta that determine how quickly SMRs are deployed in the province,” he added, noting that “a lot of the interest in Alberta is coming in the form of potential oilsands [uses]… But remote communities, remote mining operations” are other possibilities, he said. “And a lot of interest has been expressed in hydrogen and the potential for SMRs to be developed in that role.”
“The attractiveness of SMRs is … just how flexible they can be, and a lot of applications [they can have] outside of what you traditionally think of when it comes to the power generation.”
While nuclear power is federally regulated, there is much Alberta can do to prepare on the provincial side as well to pave the way for nuclear power companies to set up shop in Alberta, “to make sure that our system is ready when investors want to look at that technology,” he said.
“We are still in the early stages, but our goal is ultimately to make sure that an investor that was going to look at an SMR has clarity on how those various regimes would interact. And then figuring out that process to the first or the first few [projects] through the gate, and then a lack of clarity on how that would work would not be a barrier to SMR investment in Alberta.”

"Mining For Net Zero A Near Impossible Task, Posing Threat To Climate Goals | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Note: This piece was generated from the recently-held GeoConvention. An article that examines the role Canada can play, more closely, and the role of geoscientists, produced from the same event, is avalable at this link: Canada Risks Losing Once In Generation Opportunity On Minerals; Geoscientists’ Role Examined

Canada’s, and the world’s, targets to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions around mid century have a big stumbling block that is rarely talked about: mining for the massive volumes of metals and minerals needed to get there.
In fact, issues around mining today “really make achieving our net-zero goals extremely difficult, and I would like to say impossible,” Alan Jones, president and managing director of Ottawa-based Complete MT Solutions, told a recent GeoConvention session.
“The current and existing deposits are depleting at a very fast rate and it is very difficult to find new ones. There’s a threat to Canada in particular of the global domination of mineral resources that China poses in as much as we don't want to have a single source of supply for a lot of metals and minerals. Best is a home grown supply.”
Modern energy technologies are much more mineral intensive and tooling the energy transition will be an enormous task that requires Canada deliver a national strategy or lose out to foreign suppliers.  
“Perhaps politicians and policy advisors think that the minerals and metals needed to achieve net zero are lying around waiting to be extracted,” he said, suggesting, “most likely geoscience advice was not sought in setting these goals.”
Stymying net zero
To achieve the two degree Celsius temperature rise scenario, the world will need up to 11 times more aluminum, cobalt, lead, iron, lithium, manganese and nickel by 2050, he said. “If we only achieve double what we're producing now, we're going to be in the four-degree warming scenario.”
And to ignore the looming shortage is to stymie the energy transition. “It is becoming increasingly apparent that net-zero targets are not possible without mining, a lot more mining, much more mining,” said Jones, formerly of the Geological Survey of Canada and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.
“Huge numbers of new economic deposits must be found and be found very quickly, if we’re to achieve net zero, and are to continue technological advances without a severe throttling of progress.”
This at a time when countries are becoming increasingly reliant on minerals to drive today’s high tech economy and meet increasingly stringent climate targets. For instance, first generation cellphones used only a couple of elements, whereas a modern cellphone uses almost all of the elements in the periodic table, he said. “And the issue is that … a lot of these elements that go into modern technologies are not recycled. So every time you build a new one, you have to extract new metals from the ground.”
The same goes for renewable energy technologies like wind and solar. For a single windmill, “you need 4.7 tonnes of ore to get the copper for a windmill, you need three tonnes of aluminum ore, you need two tonnes of rare earth elements. The World Bank estimates a 250 per cent increase in minerals to meet the demands for wind turbines, if we’re going to achieve the two-degree maximum climate scenario goal by 2050. Many of these have limited recycling possibilities. So we need new mining projects.”
And solar panels “use a huge amount of silver, seven per cent of the global demand currently.” And China has moved to dominate that market. “China ramped up silver production hugely over the last 30 years. But that solar panel price crisis hasn’t begun yet.
“And the issue here is what you could call ethical supply — that half of the world’s solar grade polysilicon comes from China's vast western region where Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups have been victimized by policies. According to the U.S. government, they’re characterized as crimes against humanity and possible genocide.”
China is also assuring itself of supply for the future by going outside its borders. In 2005, China controlled seven mines outside its borders. By 2018 that had risen to 60 mines, and today it's about double that, according to Jones.
Electrified transportation
Perhaps the greatest transition involves the move to electric vehicles. “We’re at the tipping point for adoption of EVs and you can see the exponential rise in take-up of these globally. And in fact, we’re going to go through the biggest revolution of motoring since Henry Ford's first production line started in 1913. I find it ironic that Ford F150 that is associated with quote, ‘manliness,’ they are bringing it out in electric vehicles — [it] will be great to see these taking off.”
The problem is the amount of metals and minerals needed in EVs. For example, a standard internal combustion engine car uses on average about nine kilograms of copper, a hybrid electric vehicle uses 40 kilograms and a battery electric vehicle uses 83 kilograms, almost 10 times as much.
“We can recycle at about a 55 per cent rate, which is about as efficient as we’re going to get. And so we need seven megatons of new copper each and every year [by 2050] just to satisfy the EVs. And we have all these other huge amounts of nickel, carbon as well as lithium, manganese and cobalt to add into the mix, compared to a conventional car.”
Copper production alone needs to increase by 25 per cent by 2030 and 50 per cent by 2050 to reach EV production targets, he told the session. “And I would say to you that this is impossible, for copper alone, never mind the other minerals…. This is because the demand will outstrip supply hugely.”
This while supply is dropping. “That’s because over 200 major copper mines currently in operation will reach [the] end of their productive life before 2035. Some of the big copper mines in the world are almost deplete…. And that supply gap will seriously throttle the uptake of new technologies needed for adoption of net zero.”
The outlook for lithium is just as bleak, he said. “We are already in 2022 going to have a supply gap — we’re not going to have enough lithium to meet the needs. And as we shift from lithium ion to lithium sulphur [batteries], that’s going to make things worse. There’s a lot of lithium around, [the U.S. Geological Survey] estimates 21 megatons globally, but it needs to be found and it needs to be mined.”
Jones maintains that without a turnaround in mining, the tremendous gains in plummeting battery costs — about 90 per cent over the last decade — could be reversed. “The issue is that as lithium becomes scarcer and scarcer, this curve will turn around, and will sharply rise. Lithium-ion batteries will become more expensive, which will drive up the cost of the EV vehicles, which will slow down their adoption.”
Ethical supply
Another critical battery mineral, cobalt, is already in the position this year of having a supply gap. As with a number of minerals and metals, cobalt has a dominant supplier, in this case the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has tripled its production of cobalt since 2008 and now produces over two-thirds of global production. The DRC alone “absolutely dwarfs all the other producers of cobalt.
“Now cobalt is not defined as a conflict mineral. But many essential minerals, like cobalt, are currently geographically restricted to countries that have questionable human rights records,” he said. In cobalt’s case, its sourcing from southern DRC in particular “suffers from child labour, corruption, crime, poverty and its mining practices.
“In order to combat this, a number of companies have come together in what we call a Fair Cobalt Alliance, so that we're going to have ethical cobalt.”
Similarly other minerals — including “conflict minerals,” some of which are commonly found in cellphones — are targeted for ethical production. Tantalum, considered a technology-critical element whose largest producer is Rwanda, is one such example.
“The EU, since the beginning of this year, is requiring supply chain diligence of tantalum to remove tantalum's financing of conflict. This supply chain diligence could be extended to all minerals and metals — let's just have ethical minerals like we have ethical diamonds and ethical foods.”
Some companies are beginning to do this, and they've formed the Responsible Minerals Initiative and other organizations of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals, and the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade.
Four major auto manufacturers, Tesla Motors, Inc., BMW, Volkswagen Group and Ford Motor Company, are among those committed to ethical supply of cobalt through the Responsible Minerals Initiative, said Jones.
However, transitioning to low emissions technologies risks defeating the purpose if inputs are not sourced, and transported, in low emissions ways. “One thing to remember though, is there is a huge carbon cost to produce the metals we need in the green revolution. Extraction processing requires a lot of electricity and this electricity should be from renewable sources. It's not right now — most of it is produced from fossil fuels.
“Some companies are already addressing this… And we should be looking at this, [at] all points in the supply chain.”
Discovery to mine
Getting from mineral discovery to an actual mine is also becoming more difficult. Of 3,000 discoveries of mineral showings, only one ever makes it to a mine, he said, a rate that is getting worse over time. “In the 1950s of the major mineral showings, 50 per cent of them became mines within 15 years. By the 2000s, less than 10 per cent of them became mines within 15 years.
“And we're not finding them [as often]. Discoveries have dropped off precipitously since about 2010,” he said, for base metals in particular, as discoveries are getting deeper and the deposits are getting smaller. “BHP [Group] has recognized this and has doubled its exploration budget. Other companies need to do this, other countries need to put in place schemes to allow countries and companies to do this.”

Canada Risks Losing Once In Generation Opportunity On Minerals; Geoscientists’ Role Examined | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Note: This piece was generated from the recently-held GeoConvention. An earlier story on the global picture is available here: Mining For Net Zero A Near Impossible Task, Posing Threat To Climate Goals

Despite tremendous potential to produce many high demand minerals and metals, Canada is at risk of missing the opportunity to lead in their production, to stimulate its own economy and to hasten its decarbonization, according to a mining industry executive.
Canada needs a national strategy to lead the search for minerals, develop the talent to advance the mining industry and ensure its own mineral security in an increasingly mineral-dependent world, Alan Jones, president and managing director of Ottawa-based Complete MT Solutions, told the virtual GeoConvention.
There is “a complete lack of a holistic minerals plan for Canada at the national level. Take all these together, it will mean that Canada will become more and more reliant on metal supplies from other countries. And if the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we need to be self-reliant,” said Jones, who also serves as president, ManoTick GeoSolutions Ltd. and is a former senior research scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada.
Meeting Canada’s climate target of 40-45 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 will be impossible without access to the minerals and materials needed, Jones maintains.
“Ironically, the Canadian government has struck a federal Net-Zero Advisory Body comprising 14 members, all very highly competent and skilled and knowledgeable, but none of them have any experience in mining. And so the [Net-Zero] Advisory Body is not able to give advice to the Canadian government about mining, and the need for mining.”
In low emissions transportation in particular, Canada has all the right ingredients to be a leader in EV battery supply. “We've got the same geology that other countries like Australia and China are exploiting [for battery minerals]. We've got a once in a generation opportunity to establish ourselves as a major player in the global battery sector, but we have got to act fast.”
Jones points to the example of rare earth elements, which are essential to many new energy applications from electronics and renewables to automotive, aerospace and defence applications. In the 1970s and 1980s, the biggest producer in the world was the U.S. That dropped off by 2000, and subsequently “China became a monopoly supplier of rare earths by 2010.
“This is now being changed — a number of countries are recognizing this as a strategic issue. Now Australia, U.S. and some other countries — not Canada — are beginning to produce rare earths for themselves.”
Still, China has known reserves of about 44 billion tonnes, Vietnam of 22 billion tonnes and Brazil of 21 billion tonnes, while Canada has known reserves of less than a billion tonnes, Jones said. “What's that about? Canada and China are about the same physical size and we have a lot of the same geology. And the issue is, the known reserves. We just don't know. We don't know enough about Canadian geology to know what reserves we have in the Canadian Shield.”
This needs to change, Jones said, noting the U.S. has recognized the problem and, in its $2 trillion infrastructure legislation, is trying to make sure that the U.S. is not reliant on other countries for what they need as critical metals and minerals.
“What is the point of moving to net zero [in Canada] if in doing so we're creating more environmental pollution and human rights abuses? Canada should provide the world with clean rare earths.”
More exploration
Explorers know in a general sense where to look for deposits because of the study of plate tectonics and orogenesis, Jones said. “All world class ore deposits lie above geochemical and geophysical anomalies in the deep crust and the mantle,” he noted. “So we need to map tectonics, understand the tectonics on a regional scale, and then focus on a local scale.”
This is being done to some extent in Ontario and Western Quebec, though much is still unknown, such as why in western Quebec and eastern Ontario there is a very mineral rich belt but on the western side, which is about the same age, there are very few mineral deposits.
One technique that has been adopted in Australia to great effect is to use regional scale mapping, he said, where electrical resistivity modelling some 20 kilometres deep into the crust is unveiling new clues into where to find economic deposits.
“This mapping technique has been taken on board by the Australians and they're mapping the whole of Australia using this method now. Once you see these fingers [pointing upward from a deep-crustal anomaly], then you can go and do intensive studies around where the finger surfaces.”
Australia’s $225 million exploring for the future initiative known as UNCOVER, intended to provide the knowledge base and technology to substantially increase the success rate of mineral exploration, has a number of themes, including regional electromagnetic mapping, regional airborne electromagnetic mapping and seismic array imaging.
Similarly, China has a multidisciplinary earth science program called SinoProbe with an estimated budget of about $12 billion. “It's a program for mapping China and also for training young people in skills needed for the future. And the earth sciences in China has been raised to the same level of national importance as space sciences and health sciences.”
Talent shortage
Meanwhile, Canada is falling behind on the people side. “Mineral deposits are harder to find. So we need geoscientists with skills to look deep. And this is principally [a] master’s and PhD level geophysicist with a strong geology geochemistry background.”
The field is an attractive one, exhibiting a “quite low unemployment rate, and is quite decent income [and] very nice to see that the male-female income is on average the same.” But mining is still associated with “low and dirty technologies, whereas the reality is that modern mining exploration methods are just as advanced as those used in space exploration and in medical sciences.”
The sector’s age profile is also problematic — half the members of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists in 2019 were over 55 years. “Earth sciences generally is not attracting people into it [and] concerns have been expressed by many Western countries about this.” The American Geosciences Institute estimates that by 2030, there will be a skills gap of up to 130,000 geoscientists.
“Now, jobs in Canada's clean energy sector are growing hugely. It's expected over the next 10 years there will be over 200,000 jobs in the clean energy sector, whereas we'll lose about 125,000 jobs in the fossil fuels, in oil and gas. And so what does this mean? It means there's lots of jobs. Where are these people with these skills coming from? These people who have been in oil and gas don't have the right set of skills to move into renewable technology, mining fields.”
Half of geoscientists are in oil and gas, and only 10 per cent are in mining, he said. “That's got to almost flip. We have to have far more people in the mining game if we're going to meet these net-zero goals.”
“We're going to have to grow by about 200 per cent to meet these [needs]. And most of this growth has been estimated [to be needed] to occur in the Americas… In Canada, we're doing a lot of talking [about solving the problem], but not a lot of action,” he added.
Losing its lead
Thus far, Canada has been going in the wrong direction, losing global mining companies to foreign takeover, leaving Canada with just one company in the top 15, and that's a potash company. “What's happened … is that Canadian companies have been bought out by the international majors,” said Jones, pointing to the formerly largest Canadian mining companies Falconbridge Ltd. that was bought by Xstrata, then Glencore Plc, and Inco Limited taken over by Vale SA.
That leaves Canada with no national focus or effort. “We have no national Canadian mining company for net-zero metals… If we don't do something and do it soon, we are going to have to import metals, like we are doing already, and we're going to be at the mercy of other countries for access and for pricing.”
And it’s not for lack of resources, but rather lack of knowledge about where to find those resources, he stressed. “We know so little about the Canadian Shield and about Canada.”
The chair of Tesla, Robyn Denholm, recently declared the company will invest more than $1 billion in Australian EV minerals, he noted. “And Robyn said Australia is the only country in the world with resources in all three of the critical battery metals. This is nonsense. Canada is rich in lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, manganese, all key ingredients for advancing battery technology. Tesla is going to Australia because the geology is better known and the country is mining friendly.”
A national plan for minerals extraction in Canada could change that, he said. “We need a national commitment that no minerals will come into Canada, except those certified by the Responsible Minerals Initiative. We need a national co-ordinated strategy to map the whole of Canada at a regional scale using deep crustal/mantle imaging geophysical and geochemical methods. We need to emulate SinoProbe and UNCOVER. There's little sense in sending out small geological mapping groups to map small regions —  we need to know the whole of Canada first.
“We need a national strategy for training modern holistic geoscientists who are comfortable with geology, physics and chemistry. Universities are where geosciences are trained, but earth science programs are under threat everywhere due to low enrollments… We don't need a lot of geoscientists, but we do need enough, and we're not going to have enough unless we do something about it.”
Canada could potentially lead the way on clean mineral development. “The drive to net zero cannot come at the cost of environmental degradation, or human rights abuses, and Canada can contribute significantly through clean mining resulting in ethical supply.”
“But we know far too little about Canada's mineral wealth. This should become a national strategic issue. By failing to prepare, we're preparing to fail.”

‘Turquoise’ Hydrogen Can Be A Cheaper Alternative To Going ‘Blue’ | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
There are more colours to the hydrogen production spectrum than brown, blue and green — referring to production from fossil sources, adding carbon capture, or producing via electrolysis respectively.
C-Zero produces turquoise hydrogen by converting natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon, meaning the company’s chemical reaction produces no carbon dioxide.
Producers can bury or put into old coal mines the solid carbon, which resembles charcoal briquets. This is an easier method of carbon capture and storage (CCS) than trying to inject CO2 gas underground, according to Eric McFarland, C-Zero’s chief technology officer and board chair.
“Our process enables the production of solid carbon in a high-temperature, multi-phase liquid environment so the molten liquid system carry carbon out of the reactor continuously, allowing you to keep operating and producing gaseous hydrogen and a solid carbon product that can then be stored,” he told the Bulletin. “You don’t have to burn it and make CO2. Instead, you transport it out as solid carbon that can be handled much more economically.”
While methane pyrolysis is nothing new, said McFarland, C-Zero’s technology uses innovative thermocatalysis in a novel reactor to extract the carbon in natural gas as a dense solid.
The company is developing a drop-in decarbonization system to be placed in between existing natural gas infrastructure and industrial natural gas consumers seeking to lower emissions. The C-Zero method has fewer process components than blue hydrogen, he added, making it cheaper in capital cost.
“For steam-methane reforming and [CCS], commonly referred to as ‘blue’ hydrogen production, the process is more complex as it requires two kinds of catalytic reactors to enable the steam methane reforming and water-gas shift chemistry. Additionally, you also have to remove all the carbon dioxide. Once you’ve done that, you must capture that carbon dioxide in a process, compress it and pump it down into a prepared and paid for repository.
“Our process has a single reactor and single reaction. Separation and processing of the hydrogen are projected to be much lower in cost.”
Pilot planned for 2021
Currently, C-Zero is developing a pilot program, with a small commercial unit to produce hydrogen for electricity purposes or for applications in vehicles or refineries. The company hopes to start construction of its pilot by the end of 2021, according to McFarland. While C-Zero has yet to select a pilot plant location, he added, there are potential sites, including Canada.
“I wouldn’t put it in any kind of ranking, but Canada certainly has advantages because of the resources, and the ability to likely sequester the solid carbon product in some of the existing developed fields. There are many reasons why Canada would be a good location. However, I wouldn’t say Canada is number one on our list. We are also obviously looking at the Gulf Coast and other places where natural gas is available at low cost.”
A brief history of C-Zero
C-Zero was born out of the University of California through scouting work in 2015-16 at McFarland’s UC Santa Barbara laboratory. Researchers were investigating catalytic chemistries on liquid surfaces to address a variety of scientific challenges, as an interesting scientific problem. High-temperature liquid surfaces had not been previously studied, he told the DOB.
“As we worked through the experimental processes and the science of it all, the ability to make this into a process evolved. We then were able to attract investment and build a company around it. The University of California holds the intellectual property associated with the preliminary work that was done in the laboratory.”
Industry has been supportive throughout the research and development, he noted, with Royal Dutch Shell plc providing funding at the university and supporting the creation of the C-Zero commercial venture in 2018. Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Gas Company also provided seed funding, and C-Zero received several U.S. Department of Energy grants.
Last year, C-Zero announced its first priced round of investment, which was co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the Italian supermajor Eni SpA, with participation from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and AP Ventures LLP.
McFarland added: “The beauty of this process, in some ways, is that it allows the public to see that oil and gas producers can be effective in making an energy transition in a CO2-free way. It’s a way of letting the resource producers use their resources cleanly and for a longer period of time.”
Good for industry; carbon pricing helps
Pyrolysis and producing CO2-free hydrogen is already a key concern for the chemical industry, which has massive steam-methane reforming infrastructure, said McFarland. It only makes sense for these firms to utilize CCS with their existing assets, then select C-Zero technology for new capacity to more affordably reduce their CO2 footprint.
“It’s up to us to show that our technology is the lowest-cost means of producing zero-CO2 hydrogen. If we can do that, then our technology will be adopted. Fortunately, fundamentals are on our side, because as long as someone is willing to pay within the range of $35 to $60 per tonne for CO2, we can beat even optimistic estimates of what steam methane reforming with CCS can do.
“Of course, if no one is willing to pay a tax for CO2, then we cannot compete with steam-methane reforming. If there’s no tax on carbon dioxide, then the cheapest way to make hydrogen is with steam-methane reforming.”
Potential carbon market?
For small-scale production, there are markets where carbon can be valuable, McFarland said. However, successful deployment of pyrolysis systems will rapidly swamp global carbon demand. For the most part, he noted, the enormous amount of carbon produced will need to be stored. If successful, turquoise hydrogen will produce so much carbon that the carbon will need to be sequestered.
“The best place to put it would be into coal mines and locations where the excavations have already been done because you know there is transportation to those sites, and what the costs are. Also, it puts to work people who were previously harvesting those resources, allowing them to use their skills for the future.”
He added: “There are others pursuing commercial processes for methane pyrolysis, and there are existing facilities that make carbon black for applications in tires, which is a high-value carbon stream. If you’re making a high-value carbon, then the capital costs of the plant become less important, and the operating costs can be higher. If you’re selling into a higher-priced carbon market, then there are several processes that can work in those applications.”
Future bright for C-Zero
Currently, C-Zero has approximately 12 full-time employees, which will likely continue to grow as the company develops and deploys its technology, McFarland told the DOB. “We’re on track, we’re on time, and we just have to work through the engineering in a methodical way to get there.”
While “it’s clear” the public sometimes demonizes oil and gas producers on climate issues, the CTO said his firm’s technology allows the fossil fuel community to be a significant player in decarbonizing the resource sector. Rather than viewing the energy industry as harmful, he added, with C-Zero’s technology these companies can be a major part of the solution — producing an effective “green” transitional product so long as fossil fuels are available at low cost.
“I like the idea of bringing more people into the tent of trying to deal with the climate issues using the energy resources and infrastructure that are already available. The existing oil and gas community knows how to produce energy at low cost for the benefit of society, and they have been doing that for [many] years. That’s the message. This decarbonization technology really allows this community to be part of the solution.”

Imperial Helium Completes Appraisal Of Steveville Structure | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Imperial Helium Corp. has completed a successful appraisal of the Steveville structure on its helium property, located in southeastern Alberta.
Imperial Helium has completed the production testing of IHC-Steveville-1 and IHC-Steveville-2 as part of its two well appraisal well program of the Steveville structure. IHC-Steveville-2 (103/10-22-020-12W4) is a key component of the appraisal, located on the crest of the structure, adjacent to the “blow-out well” at 100/13-22-020-12W4.
Production testing of IHC-Steveville-2 and IHC-Steveville-1
In IHC-Steveville-2, a 12-metre zone was perforated over an interval equivalent to the “blow-out zone” in the offsetting 13-22 well. The perforated interval tested at a rate of two mmcf/d through a 14/64 inch choke, at a drawdown of five per cent over a period of 5.5 days.
Gas analysis confirmed a helium concentration of 0.43 per cent. The flowing pressure at surface was 1885 psi (13Mpa) which continued to increase over the entire flow period. Reservoir temperature was found to be 114.5 F (45.8 C). Liquid was produced at a rate of less than a one bbl/mmcf. Upon shut-in the pressure build-up was near instantaneous and remained constant through-out the shut-in period, which is indictive of a higher quality reservoir.
The IHC-Steveville-1 well (102/03-01-020-12W4) was located along the down-dip edge of the structure. Production testing of an interval equivalent to the helium producing intervals in IHC-Steveville-2 and 13-22 produced formation water. The presence and depth of gas in the 13-22 well, but only water in the IHC-Steveville-1 well has defined a narrow 10-metre interval for a gas/water contact.
""This result provides us with increased confidence in defining the potential producible resources within the structure,"" said the company.
Continued appraisal program & commercial development
Imperial Helium is currently integrating the results of IHC-Steveville-1 and IHC-Steveville-2 into its geological model. The company has engaged IHS Markit to conduct an independent pressure transient analysis of the production test data to help establish potential production rates and reservoir extent.
Following this, the company will make a determination of next steps in the development of the project. In addition, the IHS Markit results along with geological, geophysical, and petrophysical analyses will be forwarded to GLJ for resource certification.
As of Oct. 6, 2021, the company has a cash balance of approximately $6.6 million or $0.077/share. This strong balance sheet gives the company flexibility and the ability to deploy capital towards the continued development of its asset base.
In line with the Imperial Helium’s strategic alliance agreement, the company is in advanced discussions with its EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) partner ON2 solutions for the construction and delivery of a prototype plant.
This plant is intended to expedite the design of production facilities at Steveville and other opportunities. In addition, Imperial Helium is in discussions with offtake partners for the delivery of helium upon first production, currently anticipated to commence from the Steveville property in 2022.

Oil Companies Ask Canada To Pay For 75% Of Carbon Capture Facilities | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Oil and gas companies have asked the Canadian government to design a tax credit to pay for 75 per cent of the cost to build carbon capture facilities that will curb greenhouse gas emissions, the country's main energy industry group said on Thursday.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) made the request in August to the Department of Finance just before the federal election campaign, setting the tax credit at a level high enough to provide an economic return, Ben Brunnen, CAPP's vice-president of oilsands, told Reuters.
Carbon capture facilities are expected to be a key part of global efforts to contain emissions from fossil fuel production. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and has a set a goal of generating net-zero emissions by 2050.
The carbon captured from oil and gas operations is less concentrated than that of some other large emitters, such as fertilizer plants. That means that capture costs are higher on a per tonne basis for oil companies, Brunnen said.
""Because of that, this [credit] needs to be designed to drive a balance and reflect the economic realities,"" he said. ""The government role should be providing the playing field to enable companies to make these investments.""
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government began industry consultations in June on the make-up of its proposed carbon capture investment tax credit, before the national election last month. Trudeau won a third term and discussions are expected to resume to put the credit in place next year.
Although the government calls its proposed carbon capture support a tax credit, CAPP wants it to function more as a grant, with Ottawa reimbursing carbon capture proponents a percentage of their costs as they build the facilities, Brunnen said.

Prairie Lithium Closes Oversubscribed Private Placement | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Prairie Lithium Corporation announces the completion of a $7,506,000 private placement, of common shares and convertible debentures, led by PFM Capital Inc.
The offering was upsized from $4 million as a result of excess demand.
Prairie Lithium said it has established itself as a dual stream developer of lithium resource and lithium extraction technology. The company’s Saskatchewan-based project is well positioned, as Canada and the United States look to execute their critical mineral strategies that would see North America take a larger stake in the global battery material supply chain, it added.
“PFM is excited to partner with Prairie Lithium, which has established itself as a Western Canadian leader in this burgeoning industry,” said Jason Moser, partner and senior director of investments at PFM Capital. “We believe the company can capitalize on strong macro fundamentals and advance the industry in Saskatchewan and beyond.”
The company will use the proceeds of the private placement to fund resource exploration and development opportunities, develop its lithium extraction and refining process, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.
Stikeman Elliott LLP acted as counsel to Prairie Lithium in respect of the private placement.

"U.S. Crude Stockpiles Rise, Fuel Stocks Down In Most Recent Week – EIA | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — U.S. crude stocks rose more than anticipated as refineries pulled back on activity in the most recent week, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.
Crude stocks have been generally falling in recent months as demand has picked up with production rising only modestly. In the most recent week, stocks in the U.S. Midwest and at the Cushing, Okla., hub fell to their lowest levels since 2018.
Crude inventories rose by 6.1 million bbls in the week to Oct. 8 to 427 million bbls, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 702,000-bbl rise.
That came as refinery crude runs fell by 683,000 bbls/d, and utilization rates fell by 2.9 percentage points. Refiners often power down units at this time of year for maintenance.
“It’s all about the slide in refinery utilization rate, which is down over two per cent so you get the associated big build in crude oil,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.
Product supplied slipped in the most recent week, but the four-week average of product supplied by refineries, a proxy for demand, was 20.7 million bbls/d, about in line with pre-pandemic levels.
Crude stocks at the Cushing delivery hub fell by two million bbls in the last week, EIA said.
Meanwhile, net U.S. crude imports fell by 1.4 million bbls/d, EIA said.
U.S. gasoline stocks fell by two million bbls in the week to 223.1 million bbls, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 83,000-bbl drop.
Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 24,000 bbls in the week to 129.3 million bbls, versus expectations for a 933,000-bbl drop, the EIA data showed.

Shell-Backed Silicon Ranch Buys Solar Startup Clearloop | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — Silicon Ranch Corp., a solar developer backed by oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc, acquired a startup that funds its clean energy projects by selling carbon offsets.
Nashville, Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch bought Clearloop for an undisclosed amount to build utility-scale solar projects in distressed communities that’ll be financed by selling emissions credits to companies seeking to cut their carbon footprints, Silicon Ranch chief executive Reagan Farr said. Shell fills in the financing gaps. 
Clearloop recently broke ground on its first one megawatt project in the state with a company buying offsets for as little as $1,000, an idea inspired by crowdfunding, founder and CEO Lara Zapata said. The approach eliminates the need for long-term power sales contracts. 
“The Clearloop model democratizes the ability to participate in the energy transition,” Farr said in a telephone interview.
This new model could make solar projects more accessible for companies that haven’t had the ability to commit to 20-year contracts to buy power such as Amazon.com Inc., WalMart Inc., Apple Inc. and other corporate giants. The goal is to target communities that haven’t seen investments in a long time or places where “the grid tends to be the dirtiest,” such as the Mississippi Delta and Appalachia, Clearloop’s Zapata said.
For Shell, it’s another way to expand on its march to become the world’s largest independent power producer. Last year, the company, like many of its peers, ramped up its climate ambitions with promises to cut emissions and diversify into cleaner sources of energy. Its $3 billion-a-year ceiling for spending on renewables and low-carbon technologies compares with the $8 billion it has set aside for oil and gas this year. 
Silicon Ranch has built almost two gigawatts of solar generation in about eight years and currently has 700 megawatts under construction. The next Clearloop projects will be at least 3 megawatts, Farr and Zapata said.

IEA Says World Isn’t Investing Enough in Future Energy Needs | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Bloomberg) — The world is failing to invest in energy on the scale needed to escape catastrophic climate change and avoid sharp increases in fossil fuel prices, the International Energy Agency warned. 
In a report just weeks before COP26, the agency said that investment in green energy like solar and wind is falling short of what’s needed to keep the planet from warming up significantly. At the same time, spending on fossil fuels is lower than needed if current demand growth for oil, natural gas and coal continues. 
“There is a looming risk of more turbulence for global energy markets,” Fatih Birol, the head of the agency, said in a statement Wednesday. “We are not investing enough to meet for future energy needs.”
The stark warning comes as the global economy weathers the most crippling energy crunch in at least a decade, with rolling power blackouts hitting China and India. Even in Europe fertilizer producers and steel-makers have been forced to shut down due to record electricity and gas prices. And yet, global emissions are on track to post their second-largest annual increase in 2021, nearing an all-time high.
In the past, the agency — which advises some of the most industrialized countries including the U.S., Germany and Japan — has focused its warnings on the lack of spending in green energy. But in its flagship World Energy Outlook report it also underlined that current investment isn’t enough if the planet continues to rely as heavily on fossil fuels at it does now.  
“In recent years, investment in oil and gas supply has often appeared to be geared toward a world of stagnant or even falling demand, while purchases of internal combustion engine vehicles and expansion of natural gas infrastructure point the other way: toward ever-increasing oil and gas consumption.”
The pandemic, which led to a near-record low in new oil and gas investment in 2020, has intensified the trend, the IEA said. “If demand remains at higher levels, this would result in tight supply in the years ahead, raising the risks of higher and more volatile prices.” 
Over the last month, the cost of coal has surged to a record well above $200 a ton, surpassing the 2008 peak during the last commodity boom, and natural gas has hit all-time highs in Europe and Asia. U.K. short-term electricity prices surged at one point to more than 400 pounds ($544) per megawatt hour, about 10 times normal levels. And crude has surged to a seven-year high above US$80/bbl as demand for gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products surges.
The IEA appears to be trying to walk a fine line. In the past, it has been criticized by green campaigners for missing the explosive growth in solar and wind power and the huge drop in green energy costs. Since then, the Paris-based body changed tack, focusing more on clean energy, and at times advocating for lower spending on fossil fuels. That has worried some of the IEA’s member countries, which fear fossil fuel supply may fall faster than demand, triggering price spikes that could undermine political support for climate policies. 
Birol said that encouraging signs in clean energy were running up “against the stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels,” adding: “Governments need to resolve this at COP26 by giving a clear and unmistakable signal that they are committed to rapidly scaling up the clean and resilient technologies of the future.”
In a media conference announcing the report, Birol advocated boosting investment in green energy by at least three times the current level to meet climate change targets. He warned investors that betting on fossil fuels was a bad idea, instead predicting “handsome” returns to those who bet on green energy.
But he conceded that under the current energy demand and supply trajectory there was a looming problem. “We see a mismatch between the demand coming strongly for energy” but on the oil and gas side “not enough investments to meet the demand growth.” The solution, he said, was to invest in green energy rather than pour more money into oil and gas.
Three scenarios
The COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, that starts at the end of October, has been called the last opportunity the world has to avert catastrophic climate change.
The IEA presented policy makers with three scenarios — rather than forecasts — of how the world’s energy map may evolve over the next 30 years.
Only one, called net-zero emissions by 2050, will keep global warming to 1.5 C. That scenario calls for a dramatic drop in fossil-fuel demand, and requires a halt to developing new oil and gas fields, though the IEA conceded that investment will be needed to sustain production in some current fields.
The two other scenarios, which track climate and energy policies currently implemented and also pledges, envisage a heavier reliance on fossil fuels, and would see global temperatures rising by 2.1 C and 2.6 C, respectively.  
Whatever path the world follows, the IEA is worried that governments aren’t fulfilling their pledges to build back greener after the pandemic. Oil, gas and coal demand is rising strongly in 2021, and China has hinted at a shift in its energy and climate policy, with an emphasis on avoiding the shortages that currently are crippling its economy. 
“If you don’t change direction, you will end where you were going,” Tim Gould, IEA chief energy economist, said in an interview before the report’s publication. “Unless you change the structure of energy demand, a recovery in economic activity was always likely to lead to the re-emergence of previous patterns of both energy demand and emissions.”

Royalty Price For All Bitumen Sales Should Be Determined By Market Prices: C.D. Howe Report | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Authors of a new C.D. Howe Institute argue that the royalty price for all bitumen sales should be determined by market prices, not formulas.
In “An Oil Sands Inequity: Alberta’s Outdated Bitumen Valuation Program,” authors Joel Balyk, Benjamin Dachis and Charles DeLand examine the Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM), a government regulation that sets the price for the royalty paid for bitumen that changes hands through non-market transactions — usually between affiliates, such as when oilsands production is sent to an upgrader owned by the same company.
They argue that the royalty price for all bitumen sales should be determined by market prices, not formulas.
“The BVM has consistently overvalued the production to which it is applied, compared with market-determined values, by between $3 and $11 per barrel in recent years, thereby increasing calculated royalties for those producers,” Balyk, Dachis and DeLand write. “With well over a million barrels per day of oilsands crude oil sold at market prices, the impressive maturation of the oilsands market now provides clear price discovery.”
Designed to approximate a market price for the royalty share of non-arm’s-length bitumen, the authors found that between 2016 and 2020, BVM mining projects were assessed a higher price than their non-BVM counterparts in every year.
“To the extent that the BVM price is greater than the market price, assuming no quality or other differences, the royalty burden falls heavier on investments subject to the BVM,” they say, adding that any difference in royalty treatment tilts investment incentive away from activities that are at non-market prices, such as upgrading and refining.
Balyk, Dachis and DeLand recommend that the Alberta government replace the BVM with bitumen prices calculated from actual third-party market oilsands sales and transportation data, which could be backstopped by market-based benchmark prices for western Canadian oilsands diluted bitumen (dilbit). As well, the province should eliminate the floor-price provision, the price beneath which the calculated BVM price cannot fall.
“Eliminating the Bitumen Valuation Methodology in favour of a market-based solution would improve royalty equity between project types, increase transparency, eliminate the distortionary floor price, improve incentives for investment and reduce administrative burden,” they said.

Dividends Increase Across North American Upstream Industry | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
North American producers are refocusing on increased shareholder returns with abundant free cash flow evident across the board in Q2 2021.
This is according to Evaluate Energy’s latest review of cash spending patterns for 86 North American oil and gas producers, which can be downloaded at this link and, this quarter, includes data on dividend payments and share buybacks.
“When combining dividend payments and net share repurchases, we can see over US$4 billion spent on shareholder returns by the study group for the first time since the pandemic started in late Q1 2020,” said Mark Young, report author and senior analyst at Evaluate Energy. “Things are moving slowly but latest data reveals a renewed, concerted effort by producers to return increased earnings to shareholders.”
A jump from just over US$2 billion in total shareholder returns in Q1 to around US$4 billion three months later may not appear all that gradual – this is because two oilsands producers skew the analysis.
“Imperial and Suncor are alone responsible for 80 per cent of 2021’s total buybacks so far. The data may suggest a sudden jump in spending across the board, but these two companies are an anomaly when it comes to the whole group, at least up to the end of June.
“Where we really see more widespread increases in shareholder returns is in dividend per share data, even if the dollar values fail to jump off the page,” said Young.

As the pandemic took hold, the number of companies declaring a quarterly dividend fell sharply from 29 in Q1 2020 to just 20 in Q2 2020. As well as those nine companies that stopped paying dividends entirely, eight more reduced quarterly distributions as cash tightened.
Q1 and Q2 2021 witnessed a recovery – particularly among oil producers who comprised the bulk of North America’s dividend-paying producers before the pandemic.

By the end of June, 28 of the study group were paying dividends. Q1 and Q2 both saw 12 companies increase dividends per share from the previous quarter.
Cash used for dividends since the start of Q3 2020 increased by an average of US$276 million per quarter for the whole group.

EU To Seek Ban On Oil And Gas Exploration In The Arctic | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — The European Union will seek a ban on tapping new oil, coal and gas deposits in the Arctic to protect a region severely affected by climate change, according to a proposal for the bloc’s new Arctic strategy published on Wednesday.
The European Commission proposal reflects the EU’s efforts to boost its role on the global stage, though it has limited influence in the Arctic. It is not a member of the Arctic Council, the regional coordinating body, though three of its member states — Denmark, Finland and Sweden — are.
“The EU is committed to ensuring that oil, coal and gas stay in the ground, including in Arctic regions,” the EU executive’s proposal said, while acknowledging that the bloc itself still imports oil and gas extracted in the region.
“To this end, the Commission shall work with partners towards a multilateral legal obligation not to allow any further hydrocarbon reserve development in the Arctic or contiguous regions, nor to purchase such hydrocarbons if they were to be produced.""
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, whose country is one of the world’s largest oil and gas exporters and develops resources in the Arctic, said Moscow would eventually benefit from such a ban due to rising prices.
“If such decisions lead to a certain price volatility, [Russia’s economy] wouldn’t suffer that much. That’s because we will reduce production, but will get the prices we wanted,” Putin told an energy conference in Moscow.
The Arctic is one of the regions most affected by climate change. It has warmed three times as fast as the planet during the last 50 years, causing the ice covering land and sea to melt, sea levels to rise and permafrost to thaw.
The EU also aims under its new strategy to strengthen research into the effects of thawing permafrost that may put oilfields at risk and threaten to release greenhouse gases.
“Over 70 per cent of Arctic infrastructure and 45 per cent of oil extraction fields are built on permafrost,” said the document, which must still be approved by the EU’s 27 member states.
Potential mitigation measures could include the development of methods for local cooling and stabilization and the introduction of tougher building standards, the commission said.
The Arctic Council comprises Canada, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States as well as the three EU states, along with six Indigenous organizations, and it acts as a forum for co-operation. The EU has applied for observer status.
To boost its regional presence, the EU plans to open an office in Greenland’s capital Nuuk as the United States did last year.

"Norway To Keep Searching For Oil And Gas, New Centre-Left Government Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Norway will continue to explore for oil and gas in the next four years, with most new drilling permits to come in mature areas of the sea, the incoming centre-left government said on Wednesday.
A minority coalition of the Labour Party and the rural Centre Party will take power on Thursday after defeating the Conservative-led government in last month’s election.
“The Norwegian petroleum industry will be developed, not dismantled,” the two parties said in a joint policy document, adding that it will maintain the existing system of handing out exploration licences.
While climate change was a major issue debated during the campaign for parliament, Labour has said it wants to ensure any transition away from oil and gas, and the jobs it creates, towards green energy is a gradual one.
Norway is western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, pumping around four million boe/d and deriving half its export revenues from hydrocarbons so far this year.
The oil industry welcomed the new government’s plans.
“Giving access to attractive acreage is the most important measure authorities have to ensure continued development and value creation from oil and gas, but also to finance a green transition,” said Norwegian Oil and Gas, a lobby group.
Complicating the situation, the new minority government must seek support from opposition parties in parliament for its policies, however, some of which seek to curtail the oil industry’s drilling.
“We are about to get a new government but with the same fossil and irresponsible policies as the previous one,” Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters. “The government platform means full steam ahead on continued oil exploration.”
The agreement on the European Economic Area, allowing Norway to be part of the EU single market without being a member of the European Union, will remain in place, said Jonas Gahr Stoere, who will become prime minister in the new government.
“The EEA agreement is the basis of our relationship with Europe,” Stoere told reporters.

"NGTL Volume Restrictions Pinch Station 2 Prices, Boost AECO | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Maintenance work on TC Energy Corporation’s NGTL system in recent days has pinched supplies to AECO and flooded Spectra Station 2, resulting in a boost to AECO pricing and weakness at Station 2.
Volumes at Station 2 were fetching 50 cents yesterday (and 70 cents Wednesday). AECO spot prices were at $5.43/GJ on Thursday.
“Yesterday, NGTL, or … TC Energy, announced that starting, I think, yesterday afternoon that there would be some additional restrictions on supplies coming into the upstream transfer portion of the pipe because some of this compression work and other stuff they’re doing up there has ran longer than what they thought and they ran into a couple of unanticipated problems,” said Martin King, senior analyst with RBN Energy, LLC.
“So it may only last a few days. But effectively what that’s done is it’s partially constricted supplies that go downstream towards AECO where AECO is generally priced. So the AECO price has gone up,” he added.
“And because producers that are further upstream of that disruption are trying to get their supplies either onto Alliance or onto Westcoast — they’re all piling onto those pipes — the end result is not enough supply going into AECO and too much supply going into the Station 2 market configurations. So you’ve had a crash at Station 2 but you’ve had an uplift at AECO.”
While that situation has provided a short-term and extra boost to AECO prices, King noted that AECO has been strong in recent weeks as it has been the beneficiary of what’s been occurring in North American and global natural gas markets.
“I think with AECO in the broader sense, it’s been stronger partly just because of an uplift from U.S. gas pricing. The overall market is generally tighter than it was last year and storage in the U.S. is still a little bit below average and you’ve had some decent demand growth this year, as well, through either power generation or industrial demand — just overall demand improvement,” King said.
“And if you really want to kind of stretch things, you could say North America is also feeling some of the heat from international LNG pricing, as well. So it’s a combination of events, and for AECO it’s much more of an uplifting story in 2021 than it certainly was in the previous years.”

"Global Gas Crisis Spilling Over Into Oil Markets, IEA Says | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Bloomberg) — Shortages of natural gas in Europe and Asia are boosting demand for oil, deepening what was already a sizable supply deficit in crude markets, the International Energy Agency said.
Crude has surged above $80/bbl, the highest in three years, as traders anticipated that record gas prices would stimulate consumption of other fuels, particularly for power generation. That’s already happening and could add about 500,000 bbls/d to oil use on average over the coming six months, the IEA said on Thursday. 
“An acute shortage of natural gas, LNG and coal supplies stemming from the gathering global economic recovery has sparked a precipitous run-up in prices for energy supplies and is triggering a massive switch to oil products,” the IEA said. “Provisional August data already indicates that there is some unseasonably high demand for fuel oil, crude and middle distillates for power plants across a number of countries, including China.”
The latest analysis from the agency shows how the acute shortage of natural gas is spilling over into other markets and the broader economy. The crisis is deepening the current oil-supply deficit, potentially disrupting OPEC’s careful plan to gradually revive idle production. It’s roiling energy-intensive industries and threatens to curb GDP growth and boost inflation.
The IEA raised its estimate for demand growth this year by 300,000 bbls/d to 5.5 million bbls/d, and increased it slightly for 2022 to 3.3 million bbls/d. The effect of oil-gas switching will mostly be felt this quarter and next, the agency said.
The gas crisis isn’t entirely a net positive for oil consumption. The increase in the IEA’s demand estimates was tempered by a weaker outlook for GDP resulting mainly from supply-chain issues and rising energy costs.
“The surge in prices has swept through the entire global energy chain,” the IEA said. “Higher energy prices are also adding to inflationary pressures that, along with power outages, could lead to lower industrial activity and a slowdown in the economic recovery.”
The agency noted that OPEC+ stuck to their plan to boost production by 400,000 bbls/d “despite calls from major consuming countries for a more substantial increase.”
OPEC+ showed no signs of deviating from its plan. Speaking at Russian Energy Week in Moscow, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman reiterated his commitment to a gradual and phased revival of idle supply. The crisis engulfing other energy markets shows what a good job the group has done in regulating oil, he said.
Global oil production will rise by about 2.7 million bbls/d from September to the end of the year as OPEC+ continues to unwind its cuts and U.S. output recovers from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, the IEA said. Even with those additions, the market will be in a supply deficit of about 700,000 bbls/d for the rest of this year, before flipping back into surplus in early 2022, the IEA said.

Vermilion Achieves Responsible Producer Certification Through Equitable Origin | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
Vermilion Energy Inc. says it has achieved certification under the EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development (2017) from Equitable Origin for three of its natural gas production sites in west-central Alberta: Granada, Eta Lake and Carrot Creek.
Vermilion is the third producer of natural gas in Canada to have achieved this rigorous certification, which is based on an independent assessment of performance targets within five ESG principles: corporate governance, transparency and ethics; human rights, social impact and community development; Indigenous People’s rights; fair labour and working conditions; and climate change, biodiversity and environment.
“This significant achievement demonstrates our continued commitment to the ESG leadership we have established over the past decade, and helps achieve our goal of providing responsibly produced natural gas to the market,” said Curtis Hicks, president of Vermilion. “As the energy transition progresses, we believe it is essential to demonstrate verified excellence in the environmental and social conditions under which energy has been produced, including natural gas. Independent and stringent certifications such as Equitable Origin provide an important signal about operational quality to stakeholders such as our investors, governments and communities.”
Through its site certification program, Equitable Origin provides credible, independent recognition to energy developers that lead their sector in social and environmental performance. Certification for Vermilion’s sites included an independent third-party assessment conducted in June and July 2021, covering a policies and procedures review, in-person field visits, interviews with workers, contractors and management, and meetings with Indigenous leaders, to verify performance.
“In addition to meeting the standard for certification, which includes a commitment to continuous improvement, Vermilion demonstrated leading practices in several areas, including good faith consultation, land rights, community health and safety, and sustainable community investment,” said Soledad Mills, CEO of Equitable Origin.
Under Vermilion’s first certified natural gas transaction, a portion has been committed to supply a natural gas distributor through Macquarie Energy Canada Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group. This transaction is the result of extensive collaboration between Vermilion and the counterparties, along with Validere and Xpansiv, the global marketplace for ESG commodities, which provides the registry that ensures trust through data transparency.

"Fossil Fuels Make ‘Major Contributions” To Global Energy Mix To 2050, But Crude Demand Falls In All Scenarios: IEA | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Liquid, gaseous and solid fuels of various types will “continue to make a major contribution to the global energy mix” through to 2050 though oil demand, for the first time, shows an eventual decline in all scenarios, says the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook 2021 (WEO-2021) report released this morning.
“If all today’s announced climate pledges are met, the world would still be consuming 75 million oil barrels per day by 2050 — down from around 100 million today — but that plummets to 25 million in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario,” the IEA said in its annual report.
In its outlook, the IEA presented three scenarios — rather than forecasts — of how the world’s energy map may evolve over the next 30 years. This includes the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario from the landmark IEA report published in May, which is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 C.
As well as that scenario, the WEO-2021 explores two other scenarios to gain insights into how the global energy sector may develop over the next three decades — and what the implications would be.
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) “represents a path based on the energy and climate measures governments have actually put in place to date,” as well as specific policy initiatives that are under development.
“In this scenario, almost all of the net growth in energy demand through 2050 is met by low emissions sources, but that leaves annual emissions still around today’s levels. As a result, global average temperatures are still rising when they hit 2.6-degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in 2100,” the IEA said.
The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) maps out a path in which the net zero emissions pledges announced by governments so far are implemented in time and in full.
“In this scenario, demand for fossil fuels peaks by 2025, and global CO2 emissions fall by 40 per cent by 2050. All sectors see a decline, with the electricity sector delivering by far the largest. The global average temperature rise in 2100 is held to around 2.1-degrees Celsius,” the agency said.
Oil and natural gas demand outlook
In STEPS, the IEA said global oil demand levels off at 104 million bbls/d in the mid-2030s and then declines very slightly to 2050.

Oil use in road transport increases by around six million bbls/d through to 2030, with a particularly sharp rise in 2021, and it increases by close to eight million bbls/d in aviation, shipping and petrochemicals.
In the APS, global oil demand peaks soon after 2025 at 97 million bbls/d and declines to 77 million bbls/d in 2050. Oil use falls by around four million bbls/d in countries with net zero pledges between 2020 and 2030, but that is offset by an eight million bbl/d increase in the rest of the world.
In NZE, oil demand falls to 72 million bbls/d in 2030 and to 24 million bbls/d by 2050. By 2030, 60 per cent of all passenger cars sold globally are electric, and no new ICE passenger cars are sold anywhere after 2035. Oil use as a petrochemical feedstock is the only area to see an increase in demand; in 2050, 55 per cent of all oil consumed globally is for petrochemicals.
Natural gas demand increases in all scenarios over the next five years, with sharp divergences afterwards.
“Many factors affect to what extent, and for how long, natural gas can retain a place in the energy mix when clean energy transitions accelerate, and the outlook is far from uniform across different countries and regions,” the IEA said.
In the STEPS, natural gas demand grows to around 4,500 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2030 (15 per cent higher than in 2020) and to 5,100 bcm in 2050. Use in industry and in the power sector increases to 2050, and natural gas remains the default option for space heating.
In the APS, demand reaches its maximum level soon after 2025 and then declines to 3,850 bcm in 2050. Countries with net zero pledges move away from the use of gas in buildings, and see a near 25 per cent decrease in consumption in the power sector to 2030.
In the NZE, demand drops sharply from 2025 onwards and falls to 1,750 bcm in 2050. By 2050, more than 50 per cent of natural gas consumed is used to produce low-carbon hydrogen, and 70 per cent of gas use is in facilities equipped with CCUS.
Coal faces structural decline in all scenarios

In the STEPS, global coal demand rises slightly to 2025 and then starts a slow decline to 2050 when it is around 25 per cent lower than in 2020. Between 2025 and 2030, total coal demand in China starts to fall and there are large reductions in coal use in advanced economies, mainly as a result of lower demand in the power sector.
In the APS, global coal demand in 2030 is only six per cent lower than in the STEPS because more than 80 per cent of coal demand today comes from countries that do not have net zero pledges or aim only to reduce emissions after 2030. But it declines rapidly after 2030, notably in China, and global demand in 2050 is only half what it was in 2020.
In the NZE, global coal demand drops by 55 per cent to 2030 and by 90 per cent to 2050; in 2050, 80 per cent of the small remaining amount of coal still being used is equipped with CCUS.
Other highlights
In the STEPS, the IEA said the increase in oil demand means oil prices rise to around US$77/bbl in 2030.
Tight oil operators in the U.S. choose to prioritize returns over production growth, and tight oil satisfies much less of the increase in global oil demand than in the past. OPEC production increases by around six million bbls/d to 2030, and Russian production is maintained:
OPEC and Russia together provide 48 per cent of total oil supply in 2030, an increase from 2020 but well below their share during much of the last decade.
Internationally traded volumes of natural gas expand by over 240 bcm between 2020 and 2030.
Australia remains the largest exporter of coal although exports fall by around five per cent to 2030.
In the APS, producer countries with net zero pledges pursue efforts to minimize emissions from oil and gas operations. This increases their production costs relative to other producers as well as their financing costs, but some remain competitive and are able to increase exports of oil and gas when domestic demand declines faster than supply.
“For example, in 2030 the United States exports 3.5 million bbls/d of oil and 200 bcm of natural gas in the APS [compared with 2.5 million bbls/d of oil and 220 bcm of natural gas in the STEPS]. This puts downward pressure on prices, and limits export opportunities for a number of new and emerging producers,” the IEA said.
“OPEC and Russia together provide 48 per cent of total oil supply in 2030. Internationally traded natural gas volumes grow by 160 bcm between 2020 and 2030 [in APS], while the drop in coal demand in countries with net zero pledges means that coal exports fall from all producers.”

"Making The Steel Grade: Tenaris Introduces Canada-Produced Design, Fit For The Montney | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
Tenaris SA has tailor engineered, in Canada, a new proprietary seamless steel grade — TN 80EY — that is ideal for Montney conditions, says a company representative.
“We have been working on this for the past couple of years, seeing a need as you see more development in those shale areas,” Shellie Clark, commercial vice-president at Tenaris, told the Bulletin. “There’s opportunity elsewhere in the world, but we’ve consolidated a lot of efforts from groups around the world to build this for Canada.”
According to the company, its new steel grade, built at the Sault Ste. Marie facility, is applicable in severe sour conditions often associated with unconventional shale environments, and is adaptable to high contents of hydrogen sulphide, which is relevant for many Canadian pipeline customers. The new steel grade provides an improved burst compared to the L80-ICY steel grade, and it is a cost-competitive alternative to API T95.
“To date, there have only been two options available for sour areas — areas such as the Montney shale gas and unconventional areas in Canada,” Clark said, highlighting that one current option is below requirements, while the other is too high-spec. “This [new] product is now providing an option for those operators. It’s basically more custom made.”
She added: “It’s purpose-built for these mid-range-type parts of the reservoir, where in the end it’s a more cost-effective solution for the customer.”
When developing TN 80EY, Tenaris considered unique National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Region 3 challenges, such as physical phenomenon associated with sour service environments known as sulfide stress cracking or H2S embrittlement.
The product is not a pipeline grade, noted Clark, but is a grade of steel specifically used in well construction. “And so, you install casing in the hole, and you produce through that.”
The competition
Although there is probably a similar product available in the market to the TN 80EY steel grade, noted Clark, that would be an imported product, and one that is not manufactured in a controlled process, but rather identified as having the desired characteristics from sorting stacks of pipe, and then set aside. “They can’t verify and control the reliability and mechanical specs, essentially, through the product.”
By comparison, she told the DOB, Tenaris’s newly-developed steel grade is a mechanically-engineered, controlled product, which is better and safer for sour applications. “We worked directly with our customers, and this is a benefit to them of being able to work with the mill. That’s a distinct difference to competitive products currently out there.”
She added: “The other thing too is that we’re manufacturing this in Canada for our Canadian customers. And so, it’s unique that way. Because of that, we’re able to respond much more quickly to their lead times, which is also an attractive alternative.”
New investments
Late last year, Tenaris announced plans to transform its industrial operations to preserve long-term sustainability and growth in Canada, thanks in part to a $9 million Ontario government investment in Tenaris Algoma Tubes that leverages more than $117 million in private sector investments, creating 153 high-paying local jobs. Tenaris Algoma Tubes manufactures seamless oil country tubular goods (OCTG) and line-pipe products for the oil and gas sector.
Development of the TN 80EY product is in addition to the recent investment, noted Clark, although she said that investment probably aligns with why the company is making this new product for its customers. “We’re increasing our product portfolio, and ensuring that we can produce more in Canada for Canada. By the end of that investment, we will be able to produce about 90 per cent of what we sell.”
Product timeline
Tenaris has developed its new steel grade through the time-tested process of working closely with the operators as production requirements evolve, identifying solution gaps and utilizing the steel manufacturer’s robust engineering and technical resources and personnel to fill those gaps, said Clark.
“From those gaps, we propose and work with the R&D groups in other countries — our metallurgy department, our engineering and the technical sales — to see if there’s something we can do to adapt something we currently have, or to re-engineer something completely.
“If there is something and we see demand for it, which in this case is the growing area of the Montney, then that’s where we invest more time in developing and testing the product. It’s an iterative process. This is one of nine products we built specifically for Canada, and one of two that we’re releasing this year.”
So far, the TN 80EY product is qualified and tested, meeting all regulatory requirements, and the next step is to run the steel grade with a customer, she added.
“We’re manufacturing it at the beginning of 2022. We have customers who are very much looking forward to this, because it will impact their well costs considerably, and they achieve a better product than their options are today. We haven’t run it yet, but we expect to in Q1 2022.”

"Asia LNG Price Soars On China Power Crunch, European Demand | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — Asia LNG prices soared this week, as the world's top buyer China faced an ongoing power crunch and low inventory in Europe drove up competition for the super-chilled fuel.
The average LNG price for November delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at about $37/mmBtu, up nearly 16 per cent from the previous week, industry sources said.
December delivery prices were estimated to be about $38/mmBtu, they added.
Price agency S&P Global Platts's Japan-Korea-Marker (JKM), which is widely used as a benchmark in the spot market, had surged to a record high of $56.326/mmBtu on Wednesday, before easing later in the week.
""The market is still very bullish for winter and any piece of headline is driving up sentiment,"" a Singapore-based trader said.
Gazprom's China-focused Amur gas processing plant in Russia's Far East has halted operations after a fire early on Friday, a spokesman for the plant told Reuters.
The broader implications were not immediately clear, but the plant plays an important part in Russian gas exports to China, which has been hit by electricity shortages that have led to power rationing across the country.
Bangladesh bought on LNG cargo from Vitol for delivery in mid-October at $35.89/mmBtu and another from Gunvor for late October delivery at $36.95/mmBtu, which are the highest prices paid by the country for spot cargoes, an official of state-run Petrobangla said.
Freight rates to ship LNG rose this week and are at multi-month highs as the increase in LNG demand has driven up the need for vessels to move supplies, sources said.
Production issues at Sakhalin and Indonesia are also supporting prices, a Singapore-based source said.
Pakistan may consider only relying on term supplies should current spot prices remain elevated, an industry source said.

"China Digs In On Coal, Oil Gains As Energy Crisis Deepens | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
(Reuters) — China ordered miners in Inner Mongolia to ramp up coal production and oil prices jumped on Friday.
The rebound in economic activity from coronavirus restrictions has exposed alarmingly low supplies of natural gas leaving traders, industry executives and governments scrambling as the northern hemisphere heads into winter.
The energy crisis, which has led to fuel shortages and blackouts in some countries, has highlighted the difficulty in cutting the global economy's dependency on fossil fuels as world leaders seek to revive efforts to tackle climate change at talks next month in Glasgow.
In China, where coal production had been curtailed to meet climate goals, officials have ordered more than 70 coal mines in Inner Mongolia to ramp up production by nearly 100 million tonnes or 10 per cent, as the world's largest exporter battles its worst power shortages in years.
Russia's Gazprom, a key supplier of gas to China, calmed fears that a fire at a major gas processing plant could worsen the situation, saying it was able to continue exporting gas to China as normal.
India, the second largest coal consumer after China, is also suffering electricity outages because of a lack of coal with over half of its coal-fired power plants having less than three days’ worth of fuel stocks, data from the federal grid operator showed.
Oil prices rose on Friday, on track for gains of nearly five per cent this week, as industries switch fuel. ""A lot of catalysts are out there to keep the oil market tight,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.
Reflecting the gravity of the situation, the United States has not ruled out tapping into its strategic petroleum reserves, which it typically only does after major supply disruptions such as hurricanes, or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil, though there are doubts it is ready to take such action yet.
""DOE is actively monitoring global energy market supply and will work with our agency partners to determine if and when actions are needed,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Energy said.
Stoking tensions
Global fuel shortages are another blow to a world economy just getting back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic and threaten an expensive winter for consumers.
China is going to allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20 per cent from base levels, instead of 10-15 per cent previously, in order to prevent high energy consumption, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday, citing a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, bought two cargoes of LNG for delivery in October at record prices, two industry sources said on Friday, as low stocks in Europe boosts competition with Asia for supplies.
""It is really tough to cope with such abnormal prices. At the moment, we have no other option but to buy to keep economic activities going,"" an official of state-run Petrobangla, which oversees LNG supplies, said.  
Bangladesh is reviewing leases of five oil-fired power plants which are nearing expiry, despite its plan to move from oil towards natural gas for power generation.
Even before the current energy crisis erupted, the world was far behind on efforts to avert catastrophic climate change with a United Nations analysis estimating that global emissions would be 16 per cent higher in 2030 than they were in 2010 based on countries' current pledges.
Surging energy prices are stoking tensions in Europe over the green transition. Wealthier nations want to keep up the pressure to quit fossil fuels while poorer ones, worried about the cost to the consumer, are wary.
Britain's energy regulator warned that energy bills, which have just been hiked, are likely to rise significantly in April due to high wholesale costs which have forced some suppliers out of business.
Divisions within the European Union have deepened, with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban blaming European Union action to combat climate change for the current crisis and saying Poland and Hungary would present a united front at the next EU summit.
Analysts have said rising gas prices are the main driver of European electricity costs, while the soaring cost of permits on the EU carbon market has contributed around a fifth of the power price increase.

As part of the agreement, 195 forestry and oil and gas projects, which were permitted or authorized prior to the court decision and where activities have not yet started, will proceed. Twenty currently approved authorizations, which relate to development activities in areas of high cultural importance, will not proceed without further negotiation and agreement from Blueberry. The province has provided notification to the respective permit holders.
A spokesperson for the B.C. Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation said that of the 20 affected authorizations/permits that were previously approved but not part of this agreement, 12 were oil and gas-related permits while the other eight were forestry.
“All affected permit holders have been notified,” the spokesperson said.
Brad Herald, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers’ vice-president of Western Canada operations, said the oil and gas industry “welcomes the clarity” provided on existing approved authorizations outlined in the agreement between Blueberry River First Nations and the Province of British Columbia.
“This is an important initial step for the work to come with the engagement process and development of interim and long-term approaches for reviewing authorizations of new natural resource activities,” he said.
“We believe our partnerships with Indigenous communities and businesses support economic reconciliation; a key part of Canada’s overall approach to reconciliation.”
As reported in the DOB, no new wells were approved in B.C. in August, as the province continues to work with the BRFN on a way to improve and modernize provincial processes that recognize and respect their treaty rights.
Earlier this summer, the B.C. Supreme Court found the provincial government breached the Treaty 8 agreement signed with the BRFN because it allowed development such as forestry and natural gas extraction without the community’s approval.
Agreement detail
Blueberry River First Nations and the B.C. government reached an initial agreement, announced Thursday afternoon, “that begins to support healing the land, and helps provide stability and certainty for forestry and oil and gas permit holders in Blueberry’s traditional territory in the immediate term,” the province announced today.
The agreement follows the historic June 29, 2021, B.C. Supreme Court ruling in Blueberry River First Nations (Yahey) v. Province of British Columbia, which determined the Treaty 8 rights of the Blueberry River First Nations have been breached by development authorized by the provincial government over many years.
The initial agreement is a first step in responding to the B.C. Supreme Court’s decision, which requires the province and Blueberry to work together to develop land management processes in Blueberry territory that restore and protect the ability of the land to support Indigenous ways of life, and ensure future development authorizations manage cumulative effects on land and wildlife and their impact on the Nation’s treaty rights.
Under the agreement, the province will establish a $35-million fund for Blueberry to undertake activities to heal the land, creating jobs for Nation members and business for service providers in the northeast region. Activities will include:

land, road and seismic restoration;
river, stream and wetland restoration;
habitat connectivity;
native seed and nursery projects; and,
training for restoration activities.

In addition, $30 million will be allocated to support the Blueberry River First Nations in protecting their Indigenous way of life. Activities will include:

work on cultural areas, traplines, cabins and trails;
educational activities and materials, including teaching traditional skills and language;
expanding Blueberry River resources and capacity for land management; and,
restoring the health of wildlife through wildlife management, habitat enhancement including prescribed burning, and research.

The province and Blueberry are now working to finalize an interim approach for reviewing new natural resource activities that balance Treaty 8 rights, the economy and the environment.
Once an interim approach is in place, the negotiation teams will work to reach long-term solutions that protect Treaty 8 rights and an Indigenous way of life. They will explore establishing areas for protection and developing ecosystem-based management systems to incorporate cumulative impacts into decision-making.
The solutions will work to reset the balance promised in Treaty 8, ensuring environmental sustainability, protection of Treaty 8 rights and Indigenous culture, and stable economic activity and employment.
The province is starting dialogue with the other Treaty 8 Nations on matters of treaty rights, including advancing new environmental restoration work across Treaty 8 territory and ensuring all Treaty 8 Nations are part of the development of a new approach to how natural resource activity is planned and authorized in the territory.
The province and Blueberry will provide regular updates to, and seek input from, Blueberry members, industry, local governments and residents of the northeast as negotiations proceed.

Record Gas Prices Slow LNG Investment In Asia; N. America Scrambles On Exports | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Some of the world's biggest importers of LNG are reducing orders in the face of a 500 per cent price surge within a year, raising concerns among major producers about potential long-term destruction of demand.
LNG buyers, including numerous emerging economies in Asia, are balking at prices that have doubled just within the past month, while a growing number of exporters in North America are straining to boost export capacity that will still take years to come online.
Natural gas is viewed as a more acceptable fossil fuel as growing economies like India, China and Pakistan try to reduce carbon emissions, because it burns more cleanly than oil and coal. But the surge in natural gas prices is prompting power providers to revert to coal and fuel oil and causing a rethink on new LNG investments in Southeast Asia, which was expected to be the heart of LNG demand growth.
Within Asia, which accounts for 70 per cent of global LNG imports, a majority of long-term contracts are oil-linked. But South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh — which together account for 20 per cent of Asia's imports — have a much higher exposure to spot LNG prices, which are currently at a record high of over $50/mmBtu.
That's raised alarm among developers in Southeast Asia, as analysts say plans for new LNG regasification terminals may now be delayed given the high LNG prices and after government budgets were stretched by costly COVID-19 outbreaks, a source familiar with contract negotiations said.
""New buyers are under a lot of pressure to justify signing contracts at these prices, so they have been slow to progress discussions,"" said the source, who has noted a sharp fall in enthusiasm among potential buyers to even discuss LNG projects compared to a year ago. He declined to provide more details or be named due to the sensitive nature of the deals.
For big U.S. export terminal operators, rising prices were initially welcome. However, the volatility in costs makes it harder to sign additional long-term contracts and is a source of frustration, as they know that they will only be able to add incremental export capacity in the next year.
""We didn't like the low and flat prices everywhere in the world of around $2 per mmBtu from a year ago, and I'm not sure what I dislike more with the very elevated prices we find ourselves in now,"" said Anatol Feygin, chief commercial officer at Cheniere Energy Inc., the largest LNG exporter in the United States. ""It is a manifestation of the markets not being very good at investing through the cycle.""
Feygin however said Cheniere would soon decide on an additional expansion at its Corpus Christi LNG export plant in Texas, noting that global prices, when compared with lower U.S. prices, are a tailwind for the company.
U.S. benchmark gas prices are currently at seven-year highs, but at $6/mmBtu, are far from Asian and European levels. The United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcf/d of gas into LNG.
Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States, when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.
After that, the world may have to wait even longer for additional U.S. or Canadian projects. Houston-based Tellurian Inc.,which announced three long-term deals over the summer to sell LNG to units of Royal Dutch Shell plc, Vitol SA and Gunvor Group, is expected to start producing LNG in late 2025 at the earliest, said Charif Souki, executive chairman.
In British Columbia, LNG Canada is not expected to go into service until around 2025. In addition, numerous proposed projects were scuttled between 2019 and 2020 due to persistently low prices.
Lack of investment
Asia's newer buyers of LNG are more affected by price volatility than established importers, who are able to blunt the impact of higher spot prices by pooling those purchases with existing lower cost oil-linked deliveries, said Wood Mackenzie Ltd. vice-president Valery Chow.
""Rising LNG import bills are putting a severe strain on national budgets and [Bangladesh and Pakistan] are actively looking to switch away from gas in favour of lower cost alternatives, like fuel oil, for power generation,"" Chow said.
Bangladesh has cut back on LNG imports, with September's total dropping by 33 per cent from the month before, Refinitiv Eikon shiptracking data showed. The country is also considering extending the leases of five oil-fired power plants and potentially increasing fuel oil imports.
Pakistan has been cancelling and re-issuing LNG tenders the past two months, and may consider relying on just term imports going forward, an industry source said.
There are signs of demand erosion in established buyers India and China. LNG imports into India are down 4.2 per cent through September compared to the same period in 2020. In China, second-tier gas importers — mostly city-gas firms —are scaling back spot purchases.
In South Korea, Asia's third largest importer, one buyer described the situation as ""chaos.”
""The current market situation is not healthy to be in,"" said Qatar's Energy Minister Saad al-Kaabi on the sidelines of a virtual LNG conference in Japan. The country is the world's largest LNG supplier, and has said it will boost output by about 40 per cent to 110 million tonnes per annum by 2026.
If LNG prices extend their recent run up, cost-conscious buyers may have no choice but to pare back demand.
""With winter... and no sign of any softening in LNG prices, demand side management and ultimately power rationing may be a last resort,"" said Chow at Wood Mackenzie.

Russia Says Nord Stream 2 Clearance May Cool Gas Prices In Europe | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that certification of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline, which expects clearance from a Germany's regulator, could cool soaring European gas prices.
Prices have spiked in response to a recovery in demand, particularly from Asia, when storage levels are low.
""I think there are two factors, which could somewhat cool off the current situation. First of all, of course, this is, definitely, completion of certification and the fastest clearance for gas supplies via the completed Nord Stream 2,"" Novak told a meeting of government officials and heads of energy companies.
Nord Stream 2, which runs on the bed of the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, is expecting certification from Germany, which could take a few months. The pipeline has faced resistance from the United States, which says the project will increase Europe's reliance on Russian energy.
Novak said an increase in gas sales on Gazprom's Electronic Sales Platform could also calm prices. Gazprom set up the ESP in 2018 for gas sales to Europe to supplement the existing long and mid-term contracts. It has suspended gas sales for delivery in 2022 since late August.
President Vladimir Putin, who chaired the meeting, has agreed with the proposed increase, adding that Russia should meet its domestic gas needs first.
Novak said some speculative trade could also be behind the soaring gas prices, which he said did not reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand.
Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, at the meeting asked Putin for the right to export natural gas from Russia. State television did not air Putin's reaction to the request.
Long-term deals
Putin told the meeting that Europe was wrong to reduce the share of long-term deals in natural gas trade in favour of the spot market instead, where prices have surged.
""We talked to the European Commission's previous lineup, and all its activity was aimed at phasing out of so-called long-term contracts,"" he said.
""It was aimed at transition to spot gas trade. And as it turned out, it has become obvious today, that this practice is a mistake.""
Gazprom has resisted moving to spot trade in Europe, preferring long-term deals, which sometimes last around 25 years.
Putin also reiterated that Russia has been a reliable energy supplier to Europe, which may see record-high Russian gas exports this year as Moscow is increasing gas supplies, including via Ukraine, in response to the energy crunch and stands ready to stabilize the market.
He said that Russian gas transit via Ukraine is set to exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom's contract with Kyiv.
Kremlin denial
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had absolutely no role in causing Europe's surging gas prices, following accusations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some in the European Parliament that Russia had not done enough to increase supplies to Europe.
""There are a couple of reasons [behind the gas crisis] — the way the economy is recovering, how demand for the energy resources is growing, as well gas storages are not filled in,"" Peskov told reporters on a daily conference call.
Putin also cited economic recovery and cold weather in Europe, which led to a reduction in gas storage as another reason behind the gas prices surge.
Peskov said Moscow was ready to discuss new long-term contracts for gas sales to European consumers and that Gazprom was meeting all its obligations.

Chief Oil & Gas Explores Sale For More Than $3B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Chief Oil & Gas LLC, the Appalachian exploration and production company founded and controlled by Texas wildcatter Trevor Rees-Jones, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than $3 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said.
Rees-Jones launched Chief Oil & Gas in 1994, and it is now one of the largest privately-owned natural gas producers in the United States. His decision to attempt a sale now comes as energy prices have surged to multi-year highs, boosting corporate valuations in the industry.
Chief Oil & Gas has hired an investment bank to begin a sale process for the company, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A Chief Oil & Gas spokesperson declined to comment.
Chief Oil & Gas operates in the Marcellus shale in northeastern Pennsylvania and has around 600,000 net acres, producing more than one bcf/d of natural gas.
The company started out in the Barnett shale formation in Texas but sold its position there in two chunks, the first going to Devon Energy Corporation in 2006 and the second to Quicksilver Resources in 2008, according to its website.
Another privately held Marcellus natural gas producer, Alta Resources, was sold in July to EQT Corp. for $2.9 billion. Alta had around 300,000 net acres and produced one bcf/d of gas.

"Shell Flags $400 Million Hurricane Hit, But Boost From Soaring Prices | Daily Oil Bulletin ","
 (Reuters) — Royal Dutch Shell plc warned on Thursday of a $400 million hit to third-quarter earnings from the damage caused by August's Hurricane Ida.
However, in an update ahead of quarterly results this month, the oil major also flagged a boost to cash flows from soaring natural gas and electricity prices.
Gas and power prices have been surging as tight gas supplies have collided with strong demand in economies recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell is the world's top seller of LNG accounting for about 20 per cent of global demand, though its sales have declined in recent months because of production problems.
The company said third-quarter cash flow at its LNG division ""is expected to be significantly impacted by large variation margin inflows on the back of the prevailing gas and electricity price environment"".
Shell will be holding more cash from buyers as deposits in the face of the large fluctuations in gas prices. The cash will eventually flow back out as prices cool.
Liquefaction in the quarter is expected to be between 7 and 7.5 million tonnes, the lowest since 2016, ""reflecting feedgas constraints and additional maintenance"", Shell said.
LNG earnings will, however, receive a boost from stronger trading results, it added.
Shell's upstream oil and gas production fell in the quarter to between 2.025 and 2.1 million boe/d owing to a prolonged outage of about 90,000 boe/d at some of its offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida.
Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, said sales volumes were expected to be between 4.3 and 5.3 million bbls/d, the highest since the first quarter of 2020 but still well below pre-pandemic levels.
Refinery utilization rates will be impacted by outages due to Hurricane Ida.
In the second quarter, Shell boosted its dividend by 38 per cent for a second consecutive quarter and launched a $2 billion share buyback program following the sharp rise in oil and gas prices.

Pennsylvania Charges Energy Transfer With Environmental Crimes | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro charged Energy Transfer LP with 48 counts of environmental crimes for its conduct during construction of the long-delayed Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline.
""There is a duty to protect our air and water, and when companies harm these vital resources through negligence — it is a crime,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Mariner East has been slowed by numerous work stoppages by state and local officials mostly related to sinkholes that developed near the pipeline or spills of drilling fluids used to bore under waterways.
Energy Transfer, which was not immediately available for comment, said recently it planned to complete all phases of the pipeline expansion by the end of 2021.
Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus/Utica shale in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia.
The Attorney General's office said that in addition to repeatedly spilling thousands of gallons of drilling fluid, Energy Transfer on several occasions failed to report the spills to state environmental regulators in spite of the legal requirement to do so.
In addition, the Attorney General's office said the drilling fluid contained unapproved additives at multiple locations that affected drinking water in wells.
“If convicted, this company will be sentenced to fines and restitution. There is no jail time for these environmental crimes, and fines are not enough,"" Shapiro said, noting his office was ""calling for stronger laws to hold these companies accountable.""
Energy Transfer started work on the $2.5 billion Mariner East expansion in February 2017 and originally planned to finish the 563-kilometre pipeline in the third quarter of 2017.
Since May 2017, Pennsylvania has issued about 125 notices of violation to Mariner East, mostly for drilling fluid spills, including two in September.

Southwest Gas To Buy Questar For $2B | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Southwest Gas Holdings Inc. said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Questar Pipelines from Dominion Energy for $1.975 billion, hours after activist investor Carl Icahn made public his objections to it.
For Southwest Gas, paying $1.545 billion in cash and assuming $430 million of debt, the acquisition marks a northward expansion of its operations and boosts its regulated business.
""The acquisition ... will provide significant financial and strategic benefits to our company, shareholders, employees and partners,"" said Southwest Gas chief executive John Hester, adding the deal would be accretive to earnings per share in 2022.
The announcement confirmed a Reuters report from Sunday, saying Southwest Gas was in advanced talks to acquire Questar, citing people familiar with the matter.
Referencing the article in a letter to Southwest Gas's board, released earlier on Tuesday and detailing he holds a large stake in the company, Icahn said the acquisition would seriously diminish shareholder value and urged its abandonment.
Southwest Gas should instead focus on improving share price performance, which lagged peers, said the investor who has a history of agitating against U.S. utilities.  
Given Southwest Gas is paying cash, its shareholders will not vote on approving the acquisition, as they would if the company was issuing a large amount of stock to finance it.
For Dominion, the divestment comes after a previous attempt to sell Questar to the energy arm of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was called off in July over uncertainty whether antitrust regulators would approve it.  
In its own statement, Dominion said proceeds would pay down debt and support spending plans. The deal will close before year-end, subject to regulatory approval.
Questar Pipelines provides interstate natural gas transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.  
Southwest Gas serves more than two million customers in Arizona, Nevada and California.
Investment bank Lazard and law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP worked on the deal for Southwest Gas. Dominion received financial and legal advice from, respectively, Barclays and McGuireWoods LLP.

PETRONAS Plans To Scale Up CCS At Kasawari Gas Field | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — PETRONAS plans to scale up a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project as part of the second phase of development at the Kasawari gas field off Sarawak, its CEO said.
The CCS project at the field, which is estimated to hold three tcf of gas reserves, is key to the state energy firm's plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
""This will potentially be one of the world's largest CCS projects,"" CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Aziz said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday at the Reuters Impact conference.
It will be able to capture more than 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, he said.
""It's a tricky project because it needs to deal with our own system requirements,"" he said.
""It is something that we think can be scaled up in phase two,"" he said, but declined to elaborate on the potential cost involved as the project will have to be tendered out.
While profitable and scalable CCS projects remain scarce, Taufik said he was confident that the planned stream of global investments in CCS will make it a viable means for energy firms to curb emissions.
""There are many, many projects in place in Scandinavia, our counterparts in Norway, and we've also got a template out in Australia where CCS has been deployed,"" he said.
""The question is whether the scale is large enough to make it economic.""
The Kasawari project will also ensure that PETRONAS remains one of the world's top five exporters of LNG, Taufik said.
Global gas demand accelerated this year with Asia spot prices LNG-AS hitting all-time highs as economies recover from the pandemic.
""The reality is, in any projections, even IEA's most aggressive projections of renewables displacement, we will still need hydrocarbons to be part of the energy mix,"" Taufik said, adding that natural gas will account for about a quarter of the world's energy demand.
""Many of us, my counterparts and I, believe that CCS will be part of the solution to decarbonize the extraction of hydrocarbons,"" he said.
PETRONAS is also looking at offering CCS as a solution for power and the cement, steel and chemicals sectors which are facing challenges in reducing billions of tonnes of emissions, Taufik said, adding that carbon taxes and carbon pricing will be key in making these projects economical.
He declined to comment on the carbon price that PETRONAS applies to its projects.

U.S. Natgas Futures On Track For 7-Year High As Global Prices Soar | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures jumped four per cent and were on track to reach a fresh seven-year high on Tuesday as soaring global prices kept demand for U.S. LNG exports strong.
Futures prices in Europe soared over 17 per cent for November and 18 per cent for December to fresh record highs on worries several European countries do not have enough gas stored for the coming winter heating season. Prices in Asia also traded near record levels as China and other major LNG buyers compete for available cargoes to meet their insatiable demand for the super-cooled fuel.
In the United States, traders noted that prices were rising despite forecasts for U.S. weather to remain milder than normal through late October, which should keep overall heating and cooling demand lower than usual. Of course, some regions will see lingering air conditioning use, while others will crank up their heaters.
Front-month gas futures rose 22.9 cents, or four per cent to $5.995/mmBtu at 8:11 a.m. EDT (1211 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since February 2014.
Analysts have said that stockpiles in some European countries were over 20 per cent below normal for this time of year. In the United States, meanwhile, inventories were expected to reach about 3.5 tcf by the end of October. Analysts said that should be enough for the U.S. winter heating season even though that amount would fall short of the 3.7 tcf five-year (2016-2020) average for that time of year.
Belief that the United States will have enough gas in storage for this winter and a lack of capacity to export more LNG has kept U.S. prices from rocketing to the record levels seen in Europe and Asia, but pipeline constraints and competition for expensive LNG exports were expected to boost prices to multi-year highs in California and New England this winter.
Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to an average of 91.7 bcf/d so far in October from 91.1 bcf/d in September. That compares with a monthly record of 95.4 bcf/d in November 2019.
U.S. gas demand, including exports, would slide from an average of 85.0 bcf/d this week to 83.6 bcf/d next week as the weather turns milder. That was the same as Refinitiv's forecast on Monday.
With gas prices at or near record highs of $38/mmBtu in Europe and $32 in Asia, versus just $6 in the United States, traders said buyers around the world would keep purchasing all the LNG the United States could produce.
With Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland expected to remain shut for another week of planned maintenance, Refinitiv said the amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slipped to an average of 10.2 bcf/d so far in October from 10.4 bcf/d in September.
But no matter how high global prices rise, the United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 bcf/d of gas into LNG. Global markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.

Natgas Price Surge Looms For United States This Winter | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Regional natural gas markets in the United States are seeing prices for this winter surge along with global record highs — suggesting that the energy bills causing headaches in Europe and Asia will hit the country before long.
Gas prices in Europe and Asia have more than tripled this year, causing manufacturers to curtail activity from Spain to Britain and sparking power crises in China.
The United States has been shielded from that global crunch because it has plenty of gas supply, most of which stays in the country since U.S. export capacity is still relatively small.
The benchmark U.S. natural gas contract has been rallying, lately hitting seven-year highs, but its $5.62/mmBtu price is a far cry from the $30-plus being paid in Europe and Asia.
However, the U.S. market is worried about the coming cold, particularly in New England and California — where prices for gas to be delivered this winter are far above the nationwide benchmark. In New England, buyers are expecting gas to cost more than $20/mmBtu.
High winter prices are nothing new for New England and California, where the limited number of pipelines into both regions regularly become constrained on the coldest days. But this winter could be worse.
Both regions have spent years aggressively moving away from fossil fuels through regulations, power plant retirements and carbon pricing that makes power from fossil-fired generation, particularly coal, more expensive.
U.S. gas currently being delivered to the Henry Hub terminal in Louisiana, the nation's benchmark, recently surpassed $6 for the first time since 2014. For January that price is in the same range, suggesting buyers think the country as a whole will have ample pipeline and storage access to keep fuel flowing this winter.
""Henry Hub prices continue to climb for the winter months, but we should see even bigger increases on the East and West Coasts for New England and California,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at commodity analytics firm Kpler.
In New England, gas for January delivery is soaring, trading this week at more than $22 at the region's Algonquin hub, which would be the highest price paid in a month since January and February of 2014.
That reflects the region, which turns to LNG when its pipelines become congested, will have to compete with buyers in Europe and Asia already paying a lot more for the super-cooled fuel.
Gas-fired power plants are expected to produce about 49 per cent of the electricity generated in New England. That is in line with the last five years, but overall demand is rising as the economy has recovered.
""What is driving gas prices for us is expected increased demand for pipeline gas as the economy recovers, and supply is catching up after pandemic low demand,"" said Caroline Pretyman, a spokesperson at Eversource Energy, New England's biggest energy provider.
California dreamin' on a winter's day
Prices at the Southern California Citygate for January 2022 were trading over $13 this week, which would be a record outside of February 2021, when the Texas freeze pushed gas prices to record levels in many parts of the country.
Prices are up in California because the state has been suffering through a long drought that has restricted its ability to generate electricity through hydropower. Solar has also been constrained by smoke cover from wildfires, analysts said.
As a result, the state has relied more on gas-fired plants, which are expected to account for about 45 per cent of electricity generated this winter, above the five-year average of 41 per cent as the drought limits hydropower supplies, according to federal projections.
Just four per cent of the electricity produced in California will come from hydro facilities this year, according to federal projections, down from an average of 14 per cent over the past five years.
Unlike New England, California has access to gas supplies from more regions including the Permian in Texas and New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Canada.
New England imports roughly 16 bcf of LNG during the winter, equivalent to about five per cent of its winter gas consumption. However, competition from Europe and Asia means those shipments will come at a dear cost.
Some power generators have another option — switching to burning oil. Right now, fuel oil costs about three times as much as natural gas, so that kind of switch will only happen as gas prices rise. Oil also emits about 30 per cent more carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
Analysts expect New England to start burning oil sooner than usual this year. Notably, during an extreme cold event starting in late December 2017, oil spiked to 27 per cent of overall power generation, compared with less than one per cent earlier that month, according to ISO New England, the region's grid operator.

Fossil Fuel Demand Shakes Off Pandemic | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — Demand for coal and natural gas has exceeded pre-COVID-19 highs with oil not far behind.
Global natural gas shortages, record gas and coal prices, a power crunch in China and a three-year high on oil prices all tell one story — demand for energy has roared back and the world still needs fossil fuels to meet most of those energy needs.
""The demand fall during the pandemic was entirely linked to governments' decision to restrict movements and had nothing to do with the energy transition,"" Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis at FGE told Reuters.
""The energy transition and decarbonization are decade-long strategies and do not happen overnight.""
Over three-quarters of global energy demand is still met by fossil fuels with less than a fifth by non-nuclear renewables, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Energy transition policies have come under fire for the run up in energy prices. In some places, they are having an impact, such as in Europe where high carbon prices aimed at reducing emissions have made utilities reluctant to switch on coal-fired plants to alleviate the shortage.
In China, policies to reduce emissions have contributed to the government's decision to ration energy to heavy industry.
But much of the rise in energy prices is simply because producers took enormous amounts of capacity offline last year when the pandemic led to an unprecedented fall in demand.
Producers of gas, coal, and to a lesser extent oil have been caught flat-footed by the economic recovery, much of it sparked by government stimulus spending in energy-intensive industries.
National policies have also played a role in the power supply problems. In China, state mandated power prices mean utilities simply cannot afford to burn coal and sell the power, because the cost of coal is too high to make a profit.
Chinese utilities are producing below capacity to avoid losing money, not because they cannot produce more.
Meanwhile, most gas projects take several years to design and build, so the shortage now reflects investment decisions taken pre-pandemic — and before the energy transition gathered political momentum.
The chief of the Paris-based IEA said energy transition policies were not to blame for the crisis.
""Well-managed clean energy transitions are a solution to the issues that we are seeing in gas and electricity markets today — not the cause of them,"" Fatih Birol said in a statement.
2020 losses erased
Still, the IEA's data show global demand for coal, the single largest source of CO2 emissions, surpassed pre-pandemic levels late last year.
Global coal supplies are tight because China, responsible for around half of global output, has tightened safety regulations at mines after a spate of accidents, sapping supply.
That has left China importing more coal from Indonesia, in turn leaving less for other importers such as India.
Global coal demand is set for with a 4.5 per cent increase this year, pushing beyond 2019 levels.
Global natural gas demand fell 1.9 per cent last year, a smaller drop than other energy sources as utilities cranked up power production to meet heating needs during winter.
But the IEA projects gas demand will rise 3.2 per cent in 2021 to over four trillion cubic metres, erasing 2020 losses, and pushing demand above 2019 levels.
Cold weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy said, ""caused a rise in demand for coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG), electricity and even a bit of oil [that] is here to stay.""
LNG accounts for just over 10 per cent of the global supply but is more readily traded globally so can be deployed more easily to cover short-term supply crunches.
""Eye-popping price spikes and their spread between summer and winter will widen, especially for gas, both natural and liquefied,"" Rystad added, as prices are higher amid cold winter weather than in summer.
Supply gaps, short-term rallies
Last to catch up, oil demand is set to rebound toward pre-pandemic levels above 100 million bbls/d sometime next year, according to four of the major tracking groups.
High prices on oil markets are because OPEC and allied producers still have millions of bbls per day of oil production offline after they made record cuts to supply during the pandemic to match plummeting demand for transport fuel.
OPEC offers the most robust prediction for a demand rebound, putting the recovery date at the second quarter of 2022.
In the more distant future, with most forecasters predicting a peak in fossil fuel demand within the next two decades and the IEA recommending against new projects to ensure net zero emissions, broader supply gaps could fuel more price shocks.
""Prices for fossil fuels will remain volatile"", said Nikos Tsafos, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""The risk of a supply-demand imbalance is greater in a market that is shrinking where the case for further investment is weak, which could produce short-term rallies.""

Higher Natural Gas Prices To Drive Exxon Q3 Earnings | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
(Reuters) — Exxon Mobil Corporation signalled on Thursday that higher oil and gas prices would boost third-quarter earnings by as much as $1.5 billion over the second quarter.
Natural gas prices in the United States have more than doubled this year and oil prices are up 52 per cent as energy demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exxon also has been cutting costs and laying off personnel following a historic loss in 2020. Lower costs coupled with the recent rebound in oil and gas have driven profit sharply higher.
Natural gas prices should give the U.S. oil producer the largest increase in operating profit in the quarter, the company signalled in a corporate filing. Profit from natural could rise US$500–$900 million this quarter over last, it said.
U.S. natural gas prices were trading at almost $6/mmBtu on Thursday.
Healthier refining margins could add from $500 million to $700 million in operating profits this quarter. Exxon quarter results will be posted on Oct. 29.
Chemical margins, on the other hand, could cut operating profit by between $200 million and $400 million in the quarter, the company said in the filing.
It also said unsettled derivatives could reduce operating profit from oil and gas production by $100–$500 million in the period.
Last year, the company suffered a $680 million loss in the third quarter on lower oil prices and production volumes.

Indigenous Participation In Latest Canadian LNG Proposals Breaking New Ground | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
The Cedar LNG and Ksi Lisims LNG projects are breaking new ground in allowing Indigenous people to participate in developments that could have a huge impact on their communities, while also serving as a counterpoint to LNG developments in the U.S., says a doctoral student at the University of Calgary.
“Liquefied natural gas export is a really exciting opportunity for Canada to demonstrate its leadership in climate change mitigation, as well as fostering economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Particularly when we stack ourselves up to our neighbours south of the 49th parallel,” Kienan Marion, at the UofC’s department of geoscience, said in a presentation at the recent GeoConvention 2021 event.
Marion presented the results of the paper “Comparison of GHG Emissions from LNG Canada to American Alternatives: The Canadian Advantage,” which was co-written by Deborah Esquivias and Travis Brookson (each at the UofC’s School of Public Policy) Pengfei Zhao (University of Toronto, department of civil and mineral engineering) and Jose Rogelio Hernandez Borbon (UofC, department of civil engineering).
During 2021, two Indigenous-led projects have reached important milestones, Marion said. (Note: A DOB special report published at the beginning of last year outlined Indigenous participation in previously announced Canadian LNG projects.)
First, the Nisga’a Nation, Rockies LNG and Western LNG filed the initial project description for the Ksi Lisims LNG project with the B.C. and federal governments.
Ksi Lisims LNG is a proposed 12-million-tonne-per-year LNG project at Wil Milit on the northern tip of Pearse Island near the Nisga’a village of Gingolx.
In June, meanwhile, Pembina Pipeline Corporation announced it will become the Haisla Nation’s partner in the development of the proposed Cedar LNG project. 
Cedar LNG is a proposed floating LNG facility in Kitimat, B.C., within the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation in the Douglas Channel, one of the principal shipping routes on the B.C. coast.
 “Canada has become a leader in dealing with these projects and First Nations…,” Marion said, adding that “First Nations people have historically been exploited by energy development.”
At the same time, she noted, there’s been a shift in attitude towards LNG development by the U.S. government.
“The previous [Trump] administration was pro-energy development. We find ourselves in 2021 with a far different attitude [with President Biden].”
Messages by U.S. administration officials on LNG have been mixed.
John Kerry, the U.S.’s climate envoy, told the New Yorker this summer that natural gas was needed “for the moment” but was not “anything near a long-term solution, unless somebody discovers 100 per cent abatement.”
Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has said that U.S. LNG can play an important role in replacing dirtier coal, especially in Asia, while also pressing industry to reduce methane emissions associated with natural gas production.
Roadblocks have arisen, in the U.S., though, that didn’t exist even two years ago, Marion said.
As an example, she cited the proposed Alaska LNG project, to be constructed in Nikiski, an industrial town located on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula, southwest of Anchorage.
This summer, the U.S. federal Department of Energy under the Biden administration announced that it’s ordering a supplemental environmental review of that export project.
And earlier this year, Pembina paused development of its proposed Jordan Cove LNG export plant in Oregon, according to an appeals court filing. That project faced opposition from Indigenous groups, environmentalists and a coalition of residents on Oregon’s rural southern coast.
Jordan Cove’s backers emphasized that its position on the U.S. West Coast put it closer to fast-growing Asian markets than Gulf Coast terminals, which have to send LNG through the sometimes-congested Panama Canal.
Marion said Western Canada’s closer location to Asian markets, particularly Japan, makes it more attractive to LNG buyers.
Another advantage of Canada’s West Coast LNG projects is the ability to power facilities with renewable hydro, thereby reducing GHG emissions.
Marion noted, too, that gas liquefaction in cold climates is comparably easier than in warmer regions. Lower temperatures could save energy and therefore reduce GHG emissions. The average temperature in Kitimat, B.C., for instance, is much cooler (7 C) than the U.S. Gulf Coast (e.g., 22 C in Corpus Christi, Texas).
“Western Canada is in a really unique position to export LNG to Asia given its colder ambient temperature [in comparison] to especially the U.S. Gulf Coast,” she said. “You’ve also got significantly shorter shipping distances to Asia, which reduces the amount of energy required to even get there and the cost goes down. And finally, Canada’s partnerships with Indigenous people sets them above and beyond other countries as far as ESG.”
DOB reporter Paul Wells reported on a companion GeoConvention presentation, which outlined some of the environmental benefits of using Canadian LNG, as well as the opportunity for Indigenous ‘economic reconciliation.’

PennEast Becomes The Latest To Scuttle A Natural Gas Pipeline Project | Daily Oil Bulletin ,"
 (Reuters) — PennEast Pipeline said on Monday it would stop developing a proposed pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey, the latest in a series of natural gas lines to run aground due to legal and regulatory challenges.
The project was one of several started in recent years to draw gas from the fast-growing Appalachian region, only to run into local or environmental opposition to more fossil-fuel infrastructure.
 Gas prices have surged in Europe and Asia due to rising demand and lack of supply, and that has boosted U.S. gas prices to seven-year highs.
In the United States, natural gas is used for power generation and heating more than any other fuel, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. With the cancellation of PennEast and other pipelines, the industry is becoming more concerned that additional production from the key Marcellus/Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia will become trapped in the basin.
PennEast was canceled, the company said, because it had not yet received all of its required permits, including a water quality certification in New Jersey. It was one of the last major pipeline projects in the works set to pull gas from the Marcellus/Utica formation, the biggest U.S. gas shale basin.
""The PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the project no longer is supported,"" PennEast said in an email, noting it ""has ceased all further development of the project.""
The surge in U.S. production in the past decade turned the country from a gas importer into one of the world's biggest exporters. The United States exports about 10 per cent of the gas it produces as LNG.
""The Marcellus/Utica was the growth engine of natural gas production for many years and that has slowed considerably the past two years,"" said Luke Jackson, manager North America natural gas at S&P Global Platts, noting the region was already constrained by a lack of pipelines.
U.S. natural gas prices are at a seven-year high, boosted by overseas demand for U.S. LNG exports. In other markets, gas prices are trading at record levels due to low storage in Europe and insatiable demand in Asia.
Other East Coast gas pipes held up by regulators and legal battles include Williams Cos. Inc.'s Northeast Supply Enhancement from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York, and Dominion Energy Inc.'s Atlantic Coast from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina. The latter was canceled in 2020.
PennEast decided to stop development even though the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled in its favour in a lawsuit allowing the line to seize state-owned or controlled land in New Jersey.
The 120-mile (193-km) pipe was designed to deliver 1.1 bcf/d of gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  
""The legal and regulatory roadblocks that led to the cancellation of the PennEast Pipeline — which would have been built with union labour — are putting energy affordability and reliability at risk in America,"" the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said in a statement.
PennEast initially hoped to complete the project in 2019. As recently as August, PennEast said it still hoped to finish the first phase of the $1.2 billion pipe in Pennsylvania in 2022.
