Summary Will â€œdevelop, not dismantleâ€ oil industry

Wonâ€™t try to renegotiate EEA deal with Brussels

HURDAL, Norway, Oct 13 (Reuters) â€“ Norway will continue to explore for oil and gas in the next four years, with most new drilling permits to come in mature areas of the sea, the incoming centre-left government said on Wednesday.

A minority coalition of the Labour Party and the rural Centre Party will take power on Thursday after defeating the Conservative-led government in last monthâ€™s election.

â€œThe Norwegian petroleum industry will be developed, not dismantled,â€ the two parties said in a joint policy document, adding that it will maintain the existing system of handing out exploration licences.

While climate change was a major issue debated during the campaign for parliament, Labour has said it wants to ensure any transition away from oil and gas, and the jobs it creates, towards green energy is a gradual one.

Norway is western Europeâ€™s largest oil and gas producer, pumping around four million barrels of oil equivalent per day and deriving half its export revenues from hydrocarbons so far this year.

The oil industry welcomed the new governmentâ€™s plans.

â€œGiving access to attractive acreage is the most important measure authorities have to ensure continued development and value creation from oil and gas, but also to finance a green transition,â€ said Norwegian Oil and Gas, a lobby group.

Complicating the situation, the new minority government must seek support from opposition parties in parliament for its policies, however, some of which seek to curtail the oil industryâ€™s drilling.

â€œWe are about to get a new government but with the same fossil and irresponsible policies as the previous one,â€ Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters. â€œThe government platform means full steam ahead on continued oil exploration.â€

The agreement on the European Economic Area, allowing Norway to be part of the EU single market without being a member of the European Union, will remain in place, said Jonas Gahr Stoere, who will become prime minister in the new government.

â€œThe EEA agreement is the basis of our relationship with Europe,â€ Stoere told reporters.

But Oslo will discuss more often specific cases of EU rules and legislation for implementation, according toStoereâ€™s coalition partner, Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.

â€œWe do not want this privatisation of railways that the previous government has done,â€ Vedum told reporters. â€œWe will see the concrete cases as they come.â€"

MOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) â€“ OPEC leader Saudi Arabia dismissed calls for speedier oil output increases on Thursday, saying its efforts with allies were enough and protecting the oil market from the wild price swings seen in natural gas and coal markets.

â€œWhat we see in the oil market today is an incremental (price) increase of 29%, vis-Ã -vis 500% increases in (natural) gas prices, 300% increases in coal prices, 200% increases in NGLs (natural gas liquids) â€¦,â€ Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told a forum in Moscow on Thursday.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, collectively known as OPEC+, have done a â€œremarkableâ€ job acting as â€œso-called regulator of the oil market,â€ he said.

â€œGas markets, coal markets, other sources of energy need a regulator. This situation is telling us that people need to copy and paste what OPEC+ has done and what it has achieved.â€

Asked about calls by major consumers like the United States for OPEC+ to increase production further to cool off rising oil prices, Prince Abdulaziz said: â€œI keep telling people we are increasing production.â€

He said OPEC+ would be adding 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and then again in the following months.

At its meeting earlier this month, OPEC+ stuck to its agreement of increasing production by 400,000 bpd a month as it unwinds production cuts.

â€œWe want to make sure that we reduce those excess capacities that we have developed as a result of COVID,â€ he said, adding that OPEC+ wanted to do it â€œin a gradual, phased-in approachâ€.

Prince Abdulaziz said that while OECD oil inventories were on track to normalise at the end of this year, 2022 was looking â€œa bit of a challenging yearâ€.

OPEC+ figures show the oil market is set for a surplus of about 1.4 million bpd next year."

CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) â€” Cenovus Energy Inc. (TSX: CVE) (NYSE: CVE) (â€œCenovusâ€) and Headwater Exploration Inc. (TSX: HWX) (â€œHeadwaterâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€) have closed the previously announced bought deal secondary offering (the â€œOfferingâ€) of common shares of Headwater (the â€œCommon Sharesâ€). The Offering was completed on a bought deal basis, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated effective September 27, 2021 among the Company, Cenovus, Cenovus Marten Hills Partnership, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cenovus (the â€œSelling Shareholderâ€), and a syndicate of underwriters led by Peters & Co. Limited and BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. and including CIBC World Markets Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Scotia Capital Inc., and TD Securities Inc. (collectively, the â€œUnderwritersâ€).

Pursuant to the Offering, Cenovus, through the Selling Shareholder, sold a total of 50,000,000 Common Shares (collectively, the â€œOffered Sharesâ€), including 5,000,000 Common Shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full of an over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters. The Offered Shares were sold at a price of $4.55 per Offered Share for total gross proceeds to the Selling Shareholder of $227,500,000. The Company has not and will not receive any of the proceeds of the Offering. In connection with the Offering, the Underwriters received a cash commission equal to 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares.

The Selling Shareholder and the Company entered into an investor agreement dated December 2, 2020 (the â€œInvestor Agreementâ€) in connection with the issuance of Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants (the â€œWarrantsâ€) to the Selling Shareholder. As a result of the completion of the Offering, the Investor Agreement automatically terminated in accordance with its terms. The Investor Agreement provided the Selling Shareholder with certain contractual rights related to, among other things, the nomination of directors of the Company. In connection with the termination of the Investor Agreement, Sarah Walters, who was a nominee of the Selling Shareholder on the Board of Directors (the â€œBoardâ€) of the Company, resigned as a director of the Company effective upon completion of the Offering. Kam Sandhar, who was also nominated to the Board by the Selling Shareholder pursuant to the Investor Agreement, is expected to remain on the Board following the Offering notwithstanding the termination of the Investor Agreement.

Cenovus sold the Common Shares as part of its plan to reduce its net debt levels towards its $10 billion interim target and accelerate shareholder returns. The Common Shares and Warrants were originally issued to the Selling Shareholder as partial consideration for the acquisition by Headwater of the Selling Shareholderâ€™s assets in the Marten Hills area of Alberta. Through its active development plan and early success, Headwater has accelerated the value generated from the Marten Hills asset and continues to progress its exploration program. The Offering expands Headwaterâ€™s free-trading float and is expected to provide new and existing shareholders with enhanced trading liquidity.

The Common Shares were offered by way of a short form prospectus filed by the Company in all provinces of Canada, excluding Quebec. Offered Shares were sold on a private placement basis in the United States to â€œqualified institutional buyersâ€ pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the â€œU.S. Securities Actâ€). No securities regulatory authority has either approved or disapproved of the contents of this news release.

The Common Shares have not been, nor will they be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Additional Early Warning Disclosure

This additional disclosure is provided pursuant to National Instrument 62-103â€”The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues, which also requires a report to be filed by Cenovus with the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which the Company is a reporting issuer containing information with respect to the foregoing matters (the â€œEarly Warning Reportâ€).

Prior to the Offering, the Selling Shareholder held 50,000,000 Common Shares, representing approximately 24.7% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on an undiluted basis and approximately 26.8% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to all convertible securities of the Company, including the exercise of the Warrants. Pursuant to the Offering, the Selling Shareholder disposed of legal and beneficial ownership of 50,000,000 Common Shares, being 100% of the Common Shares held by the Selling Shareholder.

Following completion of the Offering, the Selling Shareholder no longer holds any Common Shares. Cenovus, through the Selling Shareholder, continues to own 15,000,000 Warrants exercisable at $2.00 per Common Share until December 2, 2023, which have not been exercised. If the Warrants were exercised in full, Cenovus would indirectly own, through the Selling Shareholder, an aggregate of 15,000,000 Common Shares, representing approximately 6.9% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.

In connection with the Offering, net proceeds of approximately $218.4 million were paid to, and received by, the Selling Shareholder, representing the gross proceeds of the Offering less the fees paid to the Underwriters by the Selling Shareholder. The Selling Shareholder may from time to time, depending on market and other conditions, exercise the Warrants, acquire or dispose of additional Common Shares through market transactions, public offerings, private agreement or otherwise.

The Early Warning Report with additional information in respect of the foregoing matters will be filed and made available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) at sedar.com under Headwaterâ€™s issuer profile.

[],10/14/2021,"About 56% of Canadians are uncomfortable with adjusting the bankâ€™s mandate, according to the poll, conducted by Nanos Research Group for Bloomberg News. Only a third said they were comfortable with the idea.

Major central banks are grappling with how hot they should let their economies run as they begin to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Annual consumer price gains in Canada hit 4.1% in August, the highest since 2003, but policy makers led by Governor Tiff Macklem argue the surge is temporary.

The U.S. Federal Reserve last year gave itself leeway to tolerate periods of inflation above its 2% target. It adopted a policy, â€œflexible average inflation targeting,â€ with the explicit goal of having inflation run moderately above 2% for a time to make up for periods below that level.

Every five years, the Bank of Canada and the federal government negotiate the monetary policy framework, a process that must be completed by the end of 2021. The bankâ€™s current mandate targets inflation of 2%, within a control range of 1% to 3% â€” but itâ€™s been above the upper end of that range for five consecutive months.

Signing off on the bankâ€™s new mandate is one of the first itemâ€™s on Finance Minister Chrystia Freelandâ€™s desk after Trudeauâ€™s government won re-election on Sept. 20. Rising prices became a key issue during the campaign, in which the prime ministerâ€™s incumbent Liberals were held to minority control of the legislature.

The timing of the mandate renewal poses challenges to Bank of Canada officials, who are winding down emergency monetary stimulus while also facing headwinds from supply-side disruptions that threaten to curb growth. Macklem said at a press conference last week that there are â€œgood reasonsâ€ to believe increasing price pressures will be short-lived.

Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland arrive for a photo opportunity before tabling the federal budget in the House of Commons in Ottawa on April 19, 2021.

The central bank will have to decide whether to tolerate the recent high inflation readings or tighten monetary policy sooner and risk slowing down growth. Markets have priced in two rate hikes from the Bank of Canada in the next year. Most economists expect the first one in the second half of 2022.

The latest Nanos survey echoes findings by a Bank of Canada report earlier this year, which indicated that most Canadians preferred the current 2% inflation-targeting framework over alternatives. The bank has studied several options including moving toward a dual mandate that considers labor market metrics or average-inflation targeting in addition to inflation.

The Fed, unlike the Bank of Canada, already has a second mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment. A Bank of Canada move toward inflation averaging would resemble the Fedâ€™s move last year.

Nanos Research conducted the survey of more than 1,000 people from Sept. 30 to Oct. 3 via telephone and online polling. It is considered accurate to within 3.1 percentage points."
[],10/14/2021,"Recent developments in Atlantic Canadaâ€™s oil and gas sector are giving the region a boost, providing a more positive outlook as the industry moves out of recent challenging times.

First, giant Suncor Energy and its partners announced a decade-long extension to the life of the Terra Nova offshore project.

Then, the First Nations Major Projects Coalition and Miawpukek First Nation announced plans for the first-ever Indigenous equity participation in an Atlantic offshore project, LNG Newfoundland and Labrador.

â€œWe are in a province of a great need for further economic stimulation and I believe this project can do a lot to help contribute towards an economic recovery for the province,â€ says Leo Power, president of LNG Newfoundland and Labrador.

â€œItâ€™s tough today. We are still emerging from the downturn in the oil and gas industry but see much (brighter) days ahead. Thankfully the Terra Nova project is back on track and we are hoping for a positive announcement on West White Rose.â€

Construction of the $2.2-billion West White Rose project was suspended last spring amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Operator Cenovus Energy and its partners are now reviewing the project and expect to announce a decision on whether to restart by mid-2022.

In the meantime, Charlene Johnson, CEO of the Newfoundland Offshore Industry Association (NOIA), says the Terra Nova extension will have a tremendous positive impact on the province and the region.

â€œThis is excellent news for our province knowing that they will be in production for 10 more years, 70 million more barrels of oil,â€ she says.

â€œIt roughly impacts about 1,000 people directly and indirectly. But the impacts go much deeper than that when you consider the thousands of people in the service and supply sector, when you look at the benefits in terms of taxes and royalties to the province.

â€œPeople were very uncertain about their future, whether or not they were going to have a job. As soon as this was announced people were back to work immediately. Having that certainty of disposable income also helped other aspects of the economy when you look at car sales and restaurants. I talked to folks who were holding off on waiting to see if they would purchase a vehicle or not.â€

Johnson says that seeing major companies have confidence in the provinceâ€™s energy sector is welcome relief.

â€œItâ€™s been a tough 18-20 months for the folks in this industry,â€ she says. â€œI think the next couple of years are going to be busy.â€

The Terra Nova project alone has potential to support more than 1,700 jobs during the extension phase and nearly 3,400 jobs annually during its 10 years of operation, according to an economic impact report NOIA published earlier this year.

The paused West White Rose project, which is 60 per cent complete, would add about $11 billion in future capital and operating expenses out to 2036, Johnson says.

â€œWhen that was being built there were upwards of 1,400 people on site and this is in a rural part of our province. When you look at impacts to hotels in the area, restaurants, and of course employment for all those people, itâ€™s quite significant. So to see that get up and running would certainly inject a lot of more needed work and spinoffs here in the province,â€ she says.

â€œThatâ€™s a key one for us weâ€™re watching closely and one I think will be the next good thing that we hear about.â€

The First Nations Major Project Coalition and Miawpukek First Nation are looking even longer term. First LNG shipped to Europe from the $10 billion LNG Newfoundland and Labrador project is targeted for 2030.

The project is expected to generate 1,300 to 1,500 direct jobs at peak construction and 400 permanent direct jobs during operations, while meeting growing global demand for low-emissions natural gas and, potentially, clean hydrogen.

â€œOur inclusion in this project is historical, transformational, and an example of how the offshore energy industry, Canada, and Newfoundland and Labrador are truly embracing and giving effect to reconciliation,â€ Miawpukek First Nation Chief Misel Joe said in a statement."
[],10/14/2021,"Calgary Mayor Candidates Weigh In About Energy Issues That Affect Calgary

Since the energy industry is so important to many Calgarians (and Albertans), EnergyNow put together a series of energy related questions and presented them to leading contenders in the City of Calgaryâ€™s 2021 Mayoral race. All candidates were asked the same questions.

EnergyNow will be publishing the answers from the candidates that participated to let readers know where candidates stand on key energy issues that affect Calgary and in many ways, Alberta and the rest of Canada. For information purposes, only one candidate asked declined the invitation to participate.

The following candidates for the Mayor of Calgary were asked to participate (in no particular order)

EnergyNow is Pleased to Present City of Calgary Mayor Candidate

EnergyNow (EN): Do you believe fossil fuels are a sunset industry and that Albertaâ€™s massive reserves of coal, oil and natural gas will become one giant stranded asset because of the â€œenergy transitionâ€?

Brad Field (BF): Albertaâ€™s abundant supply of natural resources will be in demand for decades.

I have always been a supporter of Albertaâ€™s energy industry and its innovative companies. Thereâ€™s no doubt that the energy sector is transforming, but rather than look at it as defeat for the oil and gas sector, Calgary needs to view it as an opportunity. Our Calgary-headquartered energy companies can â€“ and already are â€“ leading the way in clean energy technology.

EN: It is well known that Houston is the epicenter of the oil and gas industry in the United States. Houston makes no apologies for this distinction. The same can be said for Calgary. It is the energy capital of Canada. Given Calgaryâ€™s current status as an energy hub, how important do you feel is the energy sector to Calgary on a go forward basis?

BF: The energy sector, including the bedrock oil and gas sector, is very important to Calgary, Alberta, and Canada. My plan includes supporting current industries and encouraging our energy sector that is diversifying and meeting the demands of a carbon-constrained world.

Support begins with creating a business-friendly culture at City Hall, so that City Council doesnâ€™t try to artificially engineer a business climate to their liking, rather than allowing the market to decide by creating a predictable regulatory environment.

A key pillar of my plan includes implementing Priority-Based Budgeting, which has proven effective in some 200 North American municipalities in setting priorities and expectations for funding. PBB gives citizens, businesses and the City more predictable and stable tax revenue and expenses, and more citizen input on spending priorities. Reasonable and predictable taxation will benefit all businesses in Calgary.

EN: A significant portion of Calgaryâ€™s downtown current empty office space was primarily occupied by the oil and gas industry. While the oil and gas industry may recover somewhat, technological changes like Artificial Intelligence (AI) have permanently reduced the head office administrative head count. What is your plan for these empty offices, and itâ€™s associated underutilized talent? Can a city be a driver of reversing this trend?

BF: The current downtown office vacancy rate of 29.2% is unprecedented across Canada and itâ€™s a shame that itâ€™s been allowed to get this bad before a plan was put in place by the City to address the issue.

While I am not a fan of costly long-term incentive programs that artificially support businesses, I think itâ€™s the Cityâ€™s role to create a business friendly-culture, and that goes beyond providing financial resources. We need an attitude at City Hall that is nimble, creative, quick and responsive to business needs. This, in combination with other strategies that I outline in my Platform, form the foundation for attracting new, 21st century industries to Calgary. By the way, ample and inexpensive downtown office space is actually an asset in attracting these businesses. We have to also ensure the other required elements, such as ensuring a young, skilled knowledge workforce is located here. Other cities have done it. We can too.

City Councilâ€™s current downtown plan also overlooks fundamental elements including downtown safety. People wonâ€™t come downtown, especially after dark, if they donâ€™t feel safe walking around or taking public transit. Inexplicably, the current plan also doesnâ€™t mention parking, or making it more accessible for people to come downtown, especially after business hours. Downtown canâ€™t be just for the people who live there.

Now is the time to convert City Hallâ€™s culture of â€œnoâ€ to a culture of â€œyesâ€.

My plan for downtown revitalization includes the following that will help with vacancy rates:

Creating economic zones that attract start-ups and support existing businesses with specific policy adjustments

Supporting the world-class facilities for conventions, tradeshows, concerts, sporting events, and tourism that are in Calgaryâ€™s current infrastructure plan

Bringing back a renewed program to make downtown safer

Creating a co-op program that uses vacant office space to educate and train students to develop a home-grown talent pipeline for the work-force of the future

Relaxing noise bylaws to incentivize more arts and culture events and festivals

Formalizing a Brewery Row and Music Mile

Addressing the high cost of parking

Improving accessibility for the mobility challenged

Supporting the private sector initiative for a train from the airport to downtown (and on to the mountains) to more easily bring business and tourism downtown

EN: While Calgary itself does not have a lot of influence on energy policy at the federal level, the incoming Mayor can play a role promoting Calgary, both with other mayors within Canada and internationally at conferences and events. What stance will you take in promoting Calgary as an energy hub for Canada, including oil and gas?

BF: I want Calgary to be known as the hub for all things energy, from traditional oil and gas to new, emerging energy sources like hydrogen. First, we have to create the right business environment that will attract companies from around the world to come to Calgary. I have a plan for that. Please visit my website (www.VoteBradField.ca/issues) to see my detailed Platform.

Second, it is critical that Calgary be seen as a leader from a provincial, national and international perspective when it comes to innovative clean energy technologies. This will positively impact the cityâ€™s reputation, and will help support the continued draw of talent and employers.

I believe the mayor, as the cityâ€™s leader, plays a role in fostering this positive reputation. I commit to being an ambassador for the city, and that includes the energy sector. I will always speak positively and supportively about our city. Weâ€™ve lost our sense of pride in what a great place Calgary is to live, do business, and build community. I have a plan to change that.

EN: Canada is the fifth largest oil and gas producing country in the world behind only the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Within Canada, Calgary is internationally recognized as one of the major oil capitals of the world and will host the World Petroleum Congress in 2023. None of the major oil producing countries in the world are being as aggressive as Canada about getting out of the oil and business, an initiative by certain politicians at the federal level. As Mayor of Calgary, what message would you like to convey to those politicians?

BF: The hostility toward Calgaryâ€™s foundational industry is often based on lack of knowledge. So many federal politicians from other parts of Canada are unaware of the huge strides the industry has taken in reducing emissions intensity, and investing in lower-emissions technology. Pipelines have become a symbol of climate change, despite the undisputed fact that they are the most environmentally friendly means to transport oil and gas. And Canada still imports human rights and environmentally irresponsible product from other countries because theyâ€™d rather do that than build a pipeline to move our higher quality product to eastern Canada. It defies logic, and one of the mayorâ€™s responsibilities has to be to provide factual information to those who just donâ€™t know.

Canadaâ€™s oil and gas sector is a leader in advancing clean energy and alternative forms of energy. The entrepreneurial spirit of the industry means that it is embracing the energy transformation, and thatâ€™s great because they need to be part of the future of energy. They have the expertise and resources required to meet the challenges of the future. Itâ€™s time to put agendas aside and work together for the betterment of all Canadians. I see oil and gas as a big part of Calgaryâ€™s future as the energy market evolves and we evolve with it.

EN: As Mayor, what message would you like to send anti-oil & gas activists? Especially those that do not live in Canada or groups that are foreign funded to interfere with oil and gas development in Canada, directly affecting Calgary?

BF: The challenges of the future require a collaborative effort to find solutions. Too often, the anti-oil and gas activistsâ€™ understanding of energy systems is based on limited, misguided information that is not grounded in realism. Iâ€™d encourage them to learn more about energy sources and systems; theyâ€™re complex and cannot be changed overnight. But letâ€™s be realistic. Oil and gas, and the pipelines that move it, have become symbols of extreme climate activism. Too many minds are already closed. We have to talk to the reasonable people who are willing to listen, and not waste too much energy on those who are not interested in facts. Calgary can be a leader in addressing climate change while also being a leader in providing the world with energy, which is the foundation of prosperity everywhere.

EN: What do you think about the Federal governmentâ€™s recently announced plan for a â€œJust Transitionâ€ for Canadaâ€™s oil and gas workers? A plan that could potentially further eliminate many Calgary jobs and displace Calgary taxpayers and their families to other cities or provinces. A summary of the federal governmentâ€™s â€œJust Transitionâ€ plan is here: https://www.rncanengagenrcan.ca/en/collections/just-transition

BF: I have the same views towards this plan as I have towards the anti-oil and gas activists. It appears those who are implementing this policy are doing so based on limited, misguided information that is not grounded in realism. There are consequences to every policy decision that is made related to energy, so we have to be thoughtful about any approach we take. I am supportive of an evolution of the energy industry that takes account of changing energy goals and needs. I am not supportive of an abrupt, unrealistic termination of the industry and the jobs and tax revenues that it generates.

EN: Have you ever been involved or associated with an anti-oil & gas campaign or group?

BF: No, I have not. I have always stood in support of the industry.

EN: How do you think Calgary should plug into the provinceâ€™s hydrogen strategy?

BF: Iâ€™m glad you asked! Alberta has all the elements that could make it a leader in the clean hydrogen economy. I will be rolling out my comprehensive hydrogen strategy soon, but here are the highlights:

Promote Calgary as a hydrogen leader. We have tremendous ingenuity and engineering expertise. We can channel this expertise to help develop a hydrogen economy, and learn from infrastructure being developed in the Edmonton region.

Promote the use of hydrogen to lower emissions. I will support a proposal for a clean hydrogen fueling hub to be built in Calgary, and the blending of hydrogen into existing natural gas pipelines, for use in homes and businesses. While it is not within the cityâ€™s jurisdiction to build the hydrogen hub, I will be a vocal supporter of this idea with clear expectations on the rate of clean hydrogen adoption by an aggressive but achievable timeline to give the right industry players the needed certainty to move towards achieving this target and timeline. We need to show Calgary being a leader in this space to attract the much-needed innovation and investment in our city.

Assess the Cityâ€™s existing vehicle fleet. I will also direct City Administration to create a formal low-and zero-emissions vehicle policy for its own fleet, including Calgary Transit, and assess the feasibility of hydrogen or electric conversion.

As with our energy sector, there will be continued expectation that other key industries, such as distribution and logistics, will work to limit their footprint and by having close access to this clean fuel, itâ€™s an opportunity to attract future distribution and logistics networks to locate in NE Calgary.

Itâ€™s great to have a goal but if we donâ€™t have the right leadership to provide a clear mandate to act on the steps needed to achieve this goal, then we will sadly fall very shy of achieving it. I am the leader required to ensure we achieve our goals.

EN: Finally, reducing energy use and emissions is not only a priority in todayâ€™s changing world but it is also welcomed by many working in Canadaâ€™s oil & gas sector. What key items do you support to help â€œgreenâ€ Calgaryâ€™s future? Is this something the city and its taxpayers should invest in for Calgary alone? Or should the city support the energy industry in the development of technologies that have global applications?

BF: I think having a sustainability, or â€œgreenâ€, strategy, which includes clean energy, is a competitive advantage now, but it will become an expectation in the near future. Thatâ€™s why in my platform document, I have a section that includes actionable items that the City can implement to support sustainability, including:

The timely completion of the Green Line including the extension of the line to the far north and south stations. Working with the private sector and other levels of government to complete a rail link from the airport to the mountains via downtown. A climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy for the city. This is where I see the energy sector playing a large role. I will advocate for investment in a large-scale multi-year retrofit program to assess the energy efficiency of City-owned buildings to achieve a 25% energy reduction by 2030. A Circular Material Warehouse and Network initiative that keeps reusable building materials out of the landfill and puts them into the hands of those that can use them. Creation of a South Calgary Wetlands initiative Protection of parks and the cityâ€™s tree canopy. We have to stop paving over them because theyâ€™re an environmental and community asset.

EnergyNow would like to thank Brad Field for his participation.

The old saying goes that voters get the governments they deserve.

21st century voting is increasingly dominated by those motivated by single issues. These include the preferred leader or specific subjects like climate change, gun control or immigration. This results in governments and decisions that donâ€™t often reflect general public opinion.

Thatâ€™s how we live in a country where the majority of Canadians support pipelines but too many elected governments obstruct them.

The upcoming vote on October 18 features one municipal election and up to four referendum initiatives, depending on where you live. There are four in Calgary. Two are important, two less so. I wrote about three. I have no opinion about fluoridating the water because I donâ€™t live within the city limits.

Calgary is the oil capital of Canada and on a short list of the most important cities in the world for the global oil and gas industry. So as an oil writer, Iâ€™ll focus on YYC.

Calgaryâ€™s Next Mayor

Whatever mayor Naheed Nenshi may or not have been when he was first elected in 2010, after 11 years at the helm he has worn out his welcome. Nenshi won the first time as an unknown in a crowded field with 39% of the votes. After the floods of 2013, his strong public assurances that Calgary would recover earned him 74% of the votes cast. But by 2017, his popularity was already fading with the economy. Of the 387,583 votes cast, 95% went to either Nenshi or challenger Bill Smith. Nenshi won with 51% of 95%.

Interest in who will comprise Calgary City Council and sit in the mayorâ€™s chair as measured by voter turnout fluctuates with the economy or perception thereof. Hereâ€™s the results for YYCâ€™s six prior elections this century.

Source: Elections Calgary, Government of Alberta

*On a scale of 1 to 10, Confidence is your writerâ€™s estimate of the perceived health of the oil industry and Albertaâ€™s economy by Calgarians who either work in the oilpatch, depend upon it, or worry about it. 1 is terrible. 10 is fantastic.

2017 â€“ low oil and gas prices, Liberals in Ottawa, NDP in Edmonton, pipeline wars and obstacles everywhere, major job losses, downtown office vacancies high, climate change mantra that fossil fuels must go.

2013 â€“ Things are pretty good. Oil prices are high, but gas prices are falling. CPC in Ottawa, PCs in Edmonton. Steady drilling and capital expenditures in oil sands, but political and environmental issues with new pipelines are becoming front page news.

2010 â€“ Emerging from the world financial crisis of 2008/09 and the New Royalty Framework of 2008 that chased investment from Alberta only recently undone.

2007 â€“ Oil and gas prices high, capital spending rising, few apparent obstacles to continued growth.

2004 â€“ Alberta starting to boom for the first time since the 1970s. Gas prices very high, oil prices rising, drilling at record levels, huge expansion plans for oil sands. Great optimism.

2001 â€“ High gas prices, oil prices starting to move, first signs of real growth after many consecutive years of tough times.

Using this data as presented, the voter turnout this year will be strong. While the oil and gas industry is enjoying a recovery thanks to rising prices, economics and confidence are not anywhere near past levels. The pandemic has been a destroyer of jobs, companies and wealth. The Liberals just won the third election in seven years. Public debt has skyrocketed. It is inevitable that everyone will have to pay more for everything through higher taxes or inflation.

In the past few years Calgary city council has been, at least outwardly, divisive and fractured. Despite talk about industrial diversification and new opportunities, the direct relationship between Canadaâ€™s oil capital and the health of the oil industry is now apparent. The high vacancy rate downtown has clobbered the property tax base. As the downtown vacancy rate has grown, property values and taxes have plunged. Because of the pandemic many businesses are struggling. In past years, big property tax revenues from full and expanding office towers downtown made it easy to fund a growing municipal government with revenue from businesses, not voters.

Like most things in Alberta, the health of the oil industry remains paramount. The downturn has affected provincial revenues, property taxes for every municipality, employment, payroll taxes, corporate taxes and individual wealth.

In Calgary, property tax increases on smaller businesses and homeowners have finally reached the point that taxes and spending by City Hall have become an election issue for many.

With Nenshi not running and the winds of change blowing from all directions, there are 26 people running for mayor. Working with EnergyNow.ca, I helped develop a series of oil and gas related questions for the publisher of this site. They concluded the major players to be Brad Field, Jeromy Farkas, Jeff Davison, Grace Yan, Jan Damery, Zane Novak and Jyoti Gondek.

Have a look. Some great information. Only Gondek declined to participate. More on this below. Full details on how each responded will continue until October 15.

Having followed politics all my life, my observation is that â€œleaderâ€ the title and â€œleaderâ€ the job are two different things. At the city level, the mayor holds this position.

Leader the title is won by campaigning with a narrative that attracts the most votes. Say the things that most the most people want to hear and win the prize.

Leader the job is entirely different. Once in office, you have to figure out how to transform all the promises and commitments intoaction and policy.

With modern party politics, execution is fairly easy. Once you become Premier or Prime Minister, you drive the bus and everyone else either falls into line or can be punished. In a political party the leader has multiple tools to enforce consensus (at least publicly) ranging from cabinet posts to nomination papers to continued caucus membership.

Municipal politics is very different. While you may get who you want for mayor, that person has to persuade the rest of council to support his or her platform. This is often difficult. This may shock you, but most people run for public office to talk, not listen. Municipal councilors donâ€™t seek election so the mayor can tell them what to do or think.

To change the course of Calgary city council â€“ for the new mayor to deliver on campaign commitments â€“ success will be measured by the ability to secure the support of others on council. This can only be done by negotiation, persuasion, consensus-building and trade-offs.

I am biased towards candidates with senior management experience in business. Success in the private sector forces executives to learn about the value of good products and services, competitive pricing, that revenue must exceed expenditures, that debt must be repaid, and that every customer counts.

In bigger successful companies, modern management includes team building and seeking consensus to ensure everyone is motivated and pulling in the same direction.

My observation is the private sector is much better at this than the public sector. Because companies have competitors and have figured out how to make more money this way.

Translated into politics, this would mean good public services, the lowest possible taxes, careful spending, low or no debt, and that every voter matters, even the ones who didnâ€™t support you.

Several candidates with significant private sector experience include Brad Field, Jeff Davison, Jan Damery and Zane Novak. Many in the private sector wish that successful entrepreneurs would run for public office because this would lead to better government. While several of the candidates meet these criteria, according to Licia Corbella in an October 9 Calgary Herald article, Field is a â€œsuper successful businessman.â€

The candidate that is polling well and but has spent her entire career in academia, public policy and association work is Jyoti Gondek. Third party advertiser Calgaryâ€™s Future officially supports Gondek. Its website reads that the organization â€œis proudly supported by local labour organizationsâ€”that means hard working Calgarians from diverse communities across the city.â€

This civic election is unique because there are so many candidates. One of these people may become mayor with less than 25% of the votes cast.

Iâ€™m not going to endorse anyone. But I am going to ask voters to think carefully about their selection. Of all the people on the ballot, who is the person who, in the position of mayor, will put the interest of all Calgarians first plus has the personality, temperament and leadership skills to build consensus on city council to deliver the best services possible at the lowest cost to taxpayers.

Because successful administration of a big, international city built primarily on oil and gas in todayâ€™s changing energy world isnâ€™t going to be accomplished by rousing speeches and unachievable campaign promises.

Or raising taxes and spending more money.

Equalization Question

Vote yes.

This should be a no brainer for anybody who believes that Alberta has not received a fair shake in Confederation due to the way the country is structured constitutionally and politically.

Example? Nova Scotia, PEI and New Brunswick with a combined population of 1.9 million have 24 senators. Alberta, with 4.4 million people, has six.

So when issues like Bills C-48 and C-69 â€“ targeted at oil development and export pipelines â€“ were opposed in the Senate by Alberta and Saskatchewan, they were passed into law anyway with only minor amendments. The northern BC oil tanker ban through Bill C-48 while tankers bring foreign oil down the St. Lawrence is so shamelessly political and regionally discriminatory it defies belief. No resource producing country in the world has ever denied its own landlocked resources tidewater access in this manner.

And amending the Constitution without the consent of Ontario and Quebec is impossible.

An appeal to review the equalization formula is one of the few tools available to a smaller province like Alberta to express its displeasure with the way Canada is structured and managed to the political advantage of the densely populated center. Canada was built so that Quebec and Ontario would always be in control and stay that way. At that time what is now Alberta was a colony. The process is rigged so that doesnâ€™t change either.

Vote yes for this question. When it passes, the entire country will pay attention.

Permanent Daylight Savings

Vote no.

Having Alberta operate on daylight savings time 365 days a year is such a dumb idea one has to wonder where it came from.

Think of all the outdoor activity â€“ personal and industrial â€“ that takes place during the winter in Alberta. Including the winter drilling season. Right now under Standard Time the sun doesnâ€™t rise in Grande Prairie before 9 AM from December 3 to January 24. Does making this 10 AM instead make any sense?

For ski resorts like Banff, the sun quits rising before 8 AM on November 16 and doesnâ€™t return until February 12. Set that back an hour and see how popular that is with outdoor enthusiasts. Ski hills that now open at 9 will have to wait until 10. Bonkers.

While there are numerous countries in the Northern Hemisphere that practice twice-annual time change to make summer days longer, nobody that I can find has introduced this on a year-round basis. While several US states have indicated they would like to do this, DC has yet to permit it.

If changing the clocks is too upsetting for by biorhythms of some, then join much of the world and move to Standard Time year-round.

Senate Nominee

Do your homework.

Alberta is trying once again to democratize the Senate by having Albertans elect preferred nominees. This has worked in the past. But the Trudeau administration recently ignored Albertaâ€™s attempts to have a say on who represents Alberta in the upper chamber by appointing the Mayor of Banff in July. It was known to the Prime Minister that this would be on the ballot October 18.

There are thirteen names on the ballot, some with party affiliations. Be careful. Duncan Kinney, for example. He fronts for the NDP through Progress Alberta and, by his own admission, is doing this to embarrass Premier Jason Kenney. He told one news outlet, â€œIf you vote for me it will surely piss Kenney off.â€

Donâ€™t forget to vote!

[],10/14/2021,"CALGARY â€” As Canadaâ€™s energy sector seeks to capitalize on high oil and gas prices and recover from a six-year downturn, a shortage of rig workers threatens to curtail the industryâ€™s growth.

After years of depressed prices, layoffs, and consolidation, oil and gas companies in Western Canada are once again ramping up production â€” this time to meet rising global energy demand as COVID-19 restrictions ease around the world.

According to The Canadian Association of Energy Contractors (CAOEC), there were 175 active drilling rigs in Canada last week, compared to just 75 in the same period last year and 155 in 2019. With the North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate trading this week at more than US$80 per barrel â€” a seven-year-high â€” the number of direct and indirect jobs in the oil and gas services sector is up 130 per cent year-over-year, said CAOEC chief executive Mark Scholz.

â€œThatâ€™s an increase of 20,750 jobs, so the industry is very bullish on activity,â€ Scholz said in an interview. â€œBut the challenge is, weâ€™re trying to ramp up so quickly that weâ€™re dealing with capacity restraints.â€

Already, companies seeking to increase oil and gas output this year are running into labour market challenges. Data from PetroLMI, an industry labour market information provider and a division of EnergySafe Canada, shows the unemployment rate in the Canadian oil and gas services sector fell from 17.7 per cent in September 2020 to 3.7 per cent in September 2021. In Saskatchewan, the current unemployment rate among oil and gas services workers is essentially zero.

â€œWeâ€™re already starting to hear some of our members indicate to our clients, who are the oil and gas producers, that we donâ€™t have any rigs available. And itâ€™s largely due to crew shortages,â€ Scholz said. â€œSo itâ€™s going to have an impact on our ability to increase production.â€

PetroLMI vice-president Carol Howes said the biggest problem facing the industry is that while employment is up substantially, the size of the oil and gas service labour force remains largely unchanged from last year. Historically, many rig workers in Western Canada have come from other parts of the country, particularly the East Coast, and they went home when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Many of those workers are reluctant to return to their jobs as long as the threat of the virus and its associated travel-related challenges continue, Howes said.

But even before the pandemic, the oil and gas sectorâ€™s labour force was eroding. Between 2013 and 2019, driven by collapsing oil prices, employment fell by 21,200, or 29 per cent, in the services sub-sector. An additional 6,300 jobs were lost in 2020, according to PetroLMI.

â€œIt has been building over the last number of years, ever since the oil price decline at the end of 2014,â€ Howes said. â€œWe saw layoffs starting to occur, we saw a decline in activity, and a lot of workers went elsewhere â€” whether that was to a different province, a different industry or a different job.â€

Scholz said workers have historically been attracted to the oilpatch because of the high wages, and he said those wages have already increased by about 10 per cent on average this year as employers compete for labour. But he said experienced workers who left the industry due to the pandemic or an oil price crash-related layoff arenâ€™t necessarily going to be enticed back for a paycheque.

â€œI think many workers are looking at this as â€˜OK, I might be making a little less per hour now, but I get to come home every day and Iâ€™m close to my family and friends,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™ve made a conscious choice to take a job with lower overall compensation, but with a lifestyle thatâ€™s more in line with what theyâ€™re comfortable with.â€

Many workers may also feel jaded after years of depressed prices, layoffs and instability in the sector, Scholz added. And while commodity prices are surging right now, the sector is still in its early phase of recovery, he said.

â€œWhen you tell people, â€˜well, we have work for you for the next couple of months,â€™ that isnâ€™t selling well. Just like everyone else, people want to have stability and consistency at work,â€ Scholz said. â€œI think the industry will likely get there eventually, where weâ€™re able to offer consistent work, but at this point weâ€™re still in this kind of intermediary phase.â€

[],10/13/2021,"CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) â€” Imperial Helium Corp. (â€œImperial Heliumâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€œ) (TSX-V: IHC) is pleased to announce it has signed an agreement with ON2 Solutions for the construction and delivery of a Prototype Plant for producing 99.999% pure (Grade A) Helium. The Prototype Plant is the Pilot Plant referenced in the Strategic Alliance Agreement among Imperial Helium, ON2 Solutions Inc., and Uniper Trading Canada Ltd. announced by Imperial Helium on March 22, 2021. The Prototype Plant, as stated in the Strategic Alliance Agreement is intended â€œto expedite the development, production and monetization of Imperial Helium projects in Canada.â€

Imperial Helium has observed that the gas mixtures associated with helium are unique to each resource accumulation. The Prototype Plant has been designed to accept a broad range of gas compositions and produce pure helium. In doing so, the Company will be able to confirm the preferred plant design for producing Grade A Helium before fabrication and installation for both the Steveville asset and other future assets. The plant will be capable of creating a synthetic gas composition resembling the dry gas composition in a particular field or a discovery. It will also be capable of processing either a synthetic gas, or a dry gas from a field or a discovery and produce 99.999% pure helium. Fabrication of the Prototype Plant will begin immediately and is anticipated to be complete by December 31, 2021, at a cost of $400,000.

David Johnson, Director and CEO commented: â€œThis Prototype Plant provides Imperial Helium with the ability to accelerate the path to monetising the Steveville asset and reduce the risk associated with plant design and fabrication before committing to installation for any asset. In the first quarter of 2022, we expect to demonstrate Imperial Heliumâ€™s ability to produce 99.999% pure Helium from the Prototype Plant, utilizing a gas sample from the Steveville asset. We remain on schedule for first production of helium from the Steveville asset in the second half of 2022.â€

Increased Current Average Production 1 to Approximately 30,600 BOPD, Highest Since February 2020

Paid Down Credit Facility Balance To $140 Million

CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) â€” Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (â€œGran Tierraâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€) (NYSE American:GTE)(TSX:GTE)(LSE:GTE) today announced an operations and financial update. All dollar amounts are in United States dollars and all production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (â€œWIâ€) basis and are expressed in barrels (â€œbblâ€) of oil per day (â€œBOPDâ€), unless otherwise stated.

Key Highlights:

Production: Gran Tierraâ€™s average production for various time periods is outlined in the table below:

1 Approximate average production over the period from October 1, 2021 to October 11, 2021.

As announced on May 17, 2021, a number of blockades across Colombia impacted several key transportation routes, resulting in the temporary shut-in of some of Gran Tierraâ€™s wells and oil fields during the second quarter of 2021.

The blockades were not directed at Gran Tierra, but caused the Company to temporarily curtail production during May and June 2021. As a result, approximately 597,000 bbl of oil production were deferred during the second quarter of 2021. Gran Tierra does not expect any negative impact on the Companyâ€™s oil reserves due to this deferral.

As announced on July 12, 2021, the Colombian government successfully negotiated the end of blockades affecting Gran Tierraâ€™s operations, which allowed the Company to restore its oil production throughout its entire Colombian portfolio. During the third quarter of 2021, Gran Tierra achieved an average production rate of approximately 29,000 BOPD, the Companyâ€™s highest average rate since the first quarter of 2020. The Companyâ€™s current average production 2 is even higher at approximately 30,600 BOPD.

is even higher at approximately 30,600 BOPD. Granâ€™s Tierraâ€™s average production during the third quarter of 2021 was up 26% from the second quarter of 2021 and up 53% from the third quarter of 2020.

Credit Facility Balance: As of September 30, 2021, the Company had paid down its credit facility balance by $25 million to $150 million, compared to balance of $175 million as of June 30, 2021 and $190 million as of December 31, 2020. As of October 8, 2021, the Company paid down its credit facility balance by an additional $10 million to $140 million.

Financial Covenants As of October 1, 2021, Gran Tierra has exited the financial covenant relief period, which provided relief from compliance with the ratio of Total Debt 3 to EBITDAX 3 from June 1, 2020, to October 1, 2021, pursuant to an amendment to the Companyâ€™s credit facility between the Company and the syndicate of lenders party thereto which had gone into effect on June 1, 2020. Gran Tierra expects to be in full compliance with all financial covenants under its credit facility on December 31, 2021.



Message to Shareholders

Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented: â€œAfter the challenges with blockades during the second quarter of 2021, we are very proud of how our teams safely and diligently ramped operations back up throughout our Colombia portfolio. During the third quarter of 2021, with production back up to an average level of approximately 29,000 BOPD and an average Brent oil price of $73.23/bbl, Gran Tierra was able to further strengthen its balance sheet. The fourth quarter of 2021 is off to an even stronger start with the Companyâ€™s average current production2 at approximately 30,600 BOPD and Brent2 averaging $81.74/bbl, which has allowed us to pay down Gran Tierraâ€™s credit facility balance to $140 million as of October 8, 2021, down $50 million from a balance of $190 million as of December 31, 2020.

With production restored, a successful 2021 drilling program, strong world oil prices and a strengthened balance sheet, we are very excited about the fourth quarter of 2021 and all of 2022.â€

Operations Update

Acordionero Oil Field (100% WI) When necessary, a workover rig was deployed during the third quarter of 2021 to restore existing wells to production if they went offline. Gran Tierra believes its prudent reservoir management of Acordioneroâ€™s waterflood has allowed the Company to restore this fieldâ€™s production to an average level of 14,427 BOPD in the third quarter of 2021, up 49% from one year ago, and the highest quarterly average production since the fourth quarter of 2019. Acordioneroâ€™s current average production 2 is 14,849 BOPD.

Costayaco Oil Field (100% WI) In March 2021, Gran Tierra commenced its infill development drilling campaign to drill 3 oil producers; this drilling program was the first in Costayaco since November 2019. The CYC-42 and CYC-43 infill oil wells were drilled during March and April of 2021 and the CYC-44 infill oil well was drilled in late April 2021. All three of these successful new oil wells started production during the third quarter of 2021 and drove a significant increase in Costayacoâ€™s average production to 6,292 BOPD during the third quarter of 2021, up 50% from 4,190 BOPD in the first quarter of 2021. Costayacoâ€™s current average production 2 is even higher at 7,144 BOPD.

Moqueta Oil Field (100% WI) During the third quarter of 2021, Gran Tierra completed a budgeted workover program that was designed to optimize Moquetaâ€™s waterflood, which may potentially increase the fieldâ€™s ultimate oil recovery.

Suroriente Block (52% WI and Operator) At the Cohembi oil field in the Suroriente Block, a facility expansion program is progressing, which is expected to allow additional production to be brought online in the fourth quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, a workover rig was deployed to run larger pumps in some oil wells. The Suroriente Blockâ€™s average WI production during the third quarter of 2021 was 3,513 BOPD, the highest average WI quarterly rate since the fourth quarter of 2019. Surorienteâ€™s current average production 2 is even higher at 4,189 BOPD.

In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, this press release contains forward-looking statements regarding: the Companyâ€™s strategies related to drilling and operation activities, expectations regarding reservoir prospects and production amounts, future well results (including initial oil production rates and productive capacity based on past performance) and operating and general and administrative costs, production guidance for 2021, the impact of the Companyâ€™s COVID-19 protocols, the Companyâ€™s expectations as to debt repayment, financial covenant compliance and its positioning for 2021 and 2022. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of Gran Tierra including, without limitation, that Gran Tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations, pricing and cost estimates (including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates), and the general continuance of assumed operational, regulatory and industry conditions in Colombia and Ecuador, and the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its business and operational plans in the manner currently planned.

Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this press release are: the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of OPEC and non-OPEC countries and the procedures imposed by governments in response thereto; disruptions to local operations; the decline and volatility in oil and gas industry conditions and commodity prices; the severe imbalance in supply and demand for oil and natural gas; prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile; the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field; the timing and impact of any resumption of operations; Gran Tierraâ€™s operations are located in South America and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity or local blockades or protests; technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production, transport or sale of our products; geographic, political and weather conditions can impact the production, transport or sale of our products; the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from current initiatives (including a reduction of the capital program); the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur; the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis; the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data, pricing and cost estimates (including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates); the risk profile of planned exploration activities; the effects of drilling down-dip; the effects of waterflood and multi-stage fracture stimulation operations; the extent and effect of delivery disruptions, equipment performance and costs; actions by third parties; the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities; the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells; unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel; the risk that current global economic and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than Gran Tierra currently predicts, which could cause Gran Tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program; volatility or declines in the trading price of our common stock or bonds; the risk that Gran Tierra does not receive the anticipated benefits of government programs, including government tax refunds; Gran Tierraâ€™s ability to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under its credit agreement; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Gran Tierraâ€™s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, under the caption â€œRisk Factorsâ€ in Gran Tierraâ€™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission website at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by Gran Tierra based on managementâ€™s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate. Gran Tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time, but the forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Gran Tierraâ€™s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements. In particular, the unprecedented nature of the current economic downturn, pandemic and industry decline may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact Gran Tierraâ€™s business and financial condition. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law.

Presentation of Oil and Gas Information

Barrels of oil equivalent (â€œBOEâ€) have been converted on the basis of 6 thousand cubic feet (â€œMcfâ€) of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value.

References to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume. Gran Tierraâ€™s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is no precise breakdown since the Companyâ€™s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil. Well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. Well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery. If it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out, any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed. References to thickness of â€œoil payâ€ or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume."

â€“ Past Workforce Forward Speaker

HR resource professionals and businesses challenged by Workforce Forwardâ€™s Leadership Council to be more culturally safe and more representative of an Indigenous workforce.

(Oct 12, 2021, Calgary Alberta) â€” Less than one-quarter (22%) of Western Canadian organizations currently have an Indigenous strategy for recruitment, and only one-in-ten (9%) are currently developing one. â€“ CPHR Alberta HR Trends Report. April 2019.

Workforce Forward, a summit being held this year virtually on Nov 30, 2021 â€“ aimed at HR professionals and businesses across Canada looking to build or improve their Indigenous inclusion strategy for recruitment, training and retention â€“ is set to improve the statistics with a series of conferences that will bridge the indubitable gap in Canadaâ€™s workforce.

â€œIâ€™m a content creator for HR professionals on issues that matter to them. I wasnâ€™t surprised at the lack of knowledge our industry has on Indigenous workforce inclusion strategies. I was surprised (and impressed) however with the surmountable desire to learn, get informed and make change to be more inclusive.â€ Andrea Adams, HR Influencer & Producer of HR Shop Talk.

Industry thought leaders have been carefully selected by the Workforce Forward Leadership Council to take part in the panels and workshops for those in the beginning stages of their strategies to those who are in the advanced stages â€“ ensuring the commitment to continuous learning for all levels is available. See full list of speakers and topics here: https://workforceforward.ca/ 2021-agenda/

â€œThere is a trend and a movement in this space to do better and Workforce Forward meets a need for those looking to improve on existing strategies or make a change to include one. Due to the pandemic, this in person event was changed to be held virtually last June and now will continue as a series on Nov 30, 2011â€“ the fourth event of its kind so far to take place in a series of many to come. The work on truth and reconciliation doesnâ€™t stop because we are dealing with a pandemic crisis. It most certainly changed how we do things and the priority on this did not stall for many companies. Organizations have used this time to work on corporate inclusiveness and are showing a more genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion â€“ so much so that weâ€™ve seen a movement with companies that now mandate it as a metric for their bottom line,â€ says Katie Comb, Co-Founder and Event Producer at the Connect Partnership Group â€“ Workforce Forward.

What are Workforce Forward workshop/panel speakers saying about Indigenous Employees & working with Indigenous Communities?

Iâ€™ve learned that in any Indigenous Inclusion activity, early and active listening to the Indigenous perspective is critical to success, which ultimately leads to greater respect, understanding and meaningful connections â€“ Scot Durward, Manager, Operations and Woodlands Human Resources â€“ TOLKO Industries

â€œMy piece of advice for those looking to be more diverse and inclusive is very simple: Approach community [and Indigenous Employees] with genuine interest and an open mind. Indigenous people are naturally relational, so building respectful relationships is key. Every community has a champion working for the betterment of community by making connections with industry. Find this person and listen to what the communityâ€™s needs are. Every community is not the same and each will have their own aspirations for their people.â€ Kirsten Ryder, Director Training & Development, Stoney Tribal Administration

â€œWorking with Indigenous communities requires respectful, meaningful dialogue in order to form genuine, beneficial relationships. Take the time to learn about Indigenous history, and the Calls to Action outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as this will form the foundation for a mutually beneficial and trusting relationshipâ€ Tim Laronde , National Director, Indigenous Strategies, Chandos Construction, Mississauga

[],10/13/2021,"Analytical intelligence systems are the key to unlocking the data to drive your business forward.

CALGARY, October 13, 2021 â€” In todayâ€™s fast changing world, leaders are pressed to do more with existing or even less resources. This means, finding efficiencies in the current systems and processes through innovative approaches. Streamline Control, an Alberta-based company leading in industrial internet of things (IIoT) technology, explains that having the right access and insights to your analytical data assets is the driving force behind any successful organization.

There are two types of data in an organization: operational data which is created from an organizationâ€™s day to day operations and analytical data which is the operational data used to make business decisions. Furthermore, operational data systems consist of transactional data and are built for quick updates. Whereas analytical data systems are tools that digest the operational data and translate them into meaningful analysis to inform better decision making.

Having the right analytical data system allows organizations to access and draw insights from their operational data which play a significant role in making the right decisions to turn marginal growth into exponential growth. In a mature industry such as oil and gas, many are still using outdated tools and technology which created data siloes. As a result, by the time the right data gets to the decision makers, they are either outdated or irrelevant. This lack of access results in detrimental effects on the organization and the risks are too high to ignore. There is a dire need to modernize, bridge, and enable operational data technology to maintain a competitive edge against competitors.

Streamline works with clients to break down the walls between the field and boardroom to cultivate real-time data to ensure accurate insights that support intelligently informed decision-making across the business and ultimately drive success. Streamline builds future-proofed systems to allow organizations tap into their current data. Having this access to the right data puts business leaders in a position of power to drive growth.

â€œAt Streamline, we have experts not only in Operational Data technologies like OSISoft, but experts in the control and communication operational processes,â€ states Jeremiah Hannley, Chief Technology Officer at Streamline. â€œWe will give your team a complete picture of your operational ecosystem. Together, we can help you support, architect and enhance your current Operational Data systems. The most important thing is to be proactive now to secure a better position for your business tomorrow.â€
