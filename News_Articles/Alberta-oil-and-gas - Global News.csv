Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge Inc. is increasing its presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast through a US$3-billion acquisition.

The Calgary-based company said Tuesday it will buy U.S.-based terminal and logistics company Moda Midstream Operating LLC from private-equity firm EnCap Flatrock Midstream.

As part of the deal, Enbridge will acquire North America’s largest crude export terminal, the Ingleside Energy Center located near Corpus Christi, Texas.

The terminal, which will be renamed the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center, comprises 15.6 million barrels of storage and 1.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. It loaded 25 percent of all U.S. Gulf Coast crude exports in 2020.

Enbridge has been seeking to build a strong position on the U.S. Gulf Coast to meet growing global demand for lower-cost, sustainable energy supply.

 

The Ingleside Energy Center is located in proximity to low-cost and long-lived oil reserves in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, said Enbridge chief executive Al Monaco.

The facility is considered to be one of North America’s most competitive export facilities, underpinned by 925,000 barrels per day of long-term take-or-pay vessel loading contracts and 15.3 million barrels of long-term storage contracts.

The deal, which will close in the fourth quarter and will initially be funded through existing liquidity, will immediately add to the company’s earnings, Monaco said.

“This blue-chip platform aligns very well with our long-standing shareholder value proposition,” he said in a news release.

Enbridge, which has set a companywide goal of becoming a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050, said it plans to lower the overall emissions from the Ingleside Energy Center by adding up to 60 MW of solar power capability to the site.

The solar capacity will be used to meet the power needs of the facility, and the excess generation will be contracted to local industrial and refining facilities.

Longer term, Enbridge said there is potential to develop additional low carbon energy infrastructure within the facility, including renewable fuels and carbon capture projects.

 

The purchase will also give Enbridge access to other crude export assets in the Gulf Coast region, including the Cactus II Pipeline, the Viola Pipeline and the Taft terminal."

Alberta’s Canadian Energy Centre appears ready to be vocal again, planning a new advertising campaign to “change perceptions” about the province’s oil and gas industry and build what it’s calling a social movement in its support.

One year after the province’s United Conservative government ended the controversial agency’s outreach during the COVID-19 pandemic, the so-called “war room” has put out a request for proposals on how to change the values and attitudes held by people in Eastern Canada and the northern United States.

The winning candidate must show a “demonstrated ability to change perceptions about messages and values,” says an Aug. 23 document. Its ultimate goal is “building a social movement” in support of Canada’s oil and gas industry.

 

“We are excited to be moving forward on the CEC’s mission — to advance Canada as the supplier of choice for the world’s growing demand for responsibly produced energy,” Tom Olsen, the centre’s director, said in an email.

The request for proposals does not include a price, which is left for the bidders to propose. The contract is to be awarded in late October and will last a year with possible extensions.

The United Conservative government established the centre to promote the energy industry and fire back against what it deems misinformation.

It has since criticized The New York Times newspaper and scolded the makers of a children’s film featuring Bigfoot for what it felt was an anti-oil message.

 

In March 2020, the province drastically reduced the centre’s resources.

That year, the agency lost about 90 per cent of its $30-million budget, which comes largely from the government’s carbon levy.

In a news release, the government said all paid advertising campaigns and work with outside contractors would stop.

The government’s February budget restored the centre’s funding to about $12 million. The advertising moratorium appears to be over with the new request for proposals.

“(The contractor will) develop and create a minimum of four consumer-direct strategic marketing campaigns that are emotional and compelling in order to measurably change perceptions about Canada’s energy sector,” the document says.

 

It says the campaign will be largely aimed at British Columbia, the Maritimes, Ontario and especially Quebec.

“(The centre) expects the proponent to have a local presence in Quebec.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""(The centre) expects the proponent to have a local presence in Quebec.""

In the U.S., the campaign is to focus on border states, refining states and states along the eastern seaboard “where policy influence is significant.”

The document says ads will be bought national and internationally. The campaign will be conducted through traditional, digital and social media, it says.

Bidders are required to submit two examples of previous work that successfully changed the attitudes of the target audience.

Founded in December 2019 as part of the then-new government’s “fight back” strategy, the Calgary-based centre was set up as a provincial government corporation but is overseen by three cabinet ministers on its board of directors.

It has suffered gaffes and missteps.

Olsen apologized after the centre questioned The New York Times’ credibility on Twitter.

The centre was also criticized for using another organization’s trademarked logo and for having its staff members refer to themselves as reporters instead of government employees.

Olsen said nearly 75,000 Canadians have sent letters or signed centre-supported petitions.

The centre, he said, has produced 363 articles, which reach more than one million Canadians a month. More than 60 per cent of the centre’s website traffic originates from outside of Alberta, Olsen said.

Imperial Oil Ltd. is planning to build a renewable diesel complex at its Strathcona refinery near Edmonton, using locally grown vegetable oils to meet growing customer demand for cleaner burning fuel products.

Calgary-based Imperial — a subsidiary of ExxonMobil and Canada’s largest petroleum refiner — said Wednesday its proposed project would be the largest facility of its kind in Canada, capable of producing more than one billion litres per year of biofuel annually.

That works out to the equivalent of about three million tonnes per year of emissions reductions from the Canadian transportation sector when compared with traditional petroleum-based diesel, said Jon Wetmore, Imperial’s vice-president of downstream.

 

“For the most part I think all of our customer base is really interested and keen on this,” Wetmore said.

“The rail companies, CN Rail and CP Rail, have probably been the most vocal looking for a renewable fuel option for their locomotives.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""The rail companies, CN Rail and CP Rail, have probably been the most vocal looking for a renewable fuel option for their locomotives.""

The new complex at Imperial’s facility along refinery row on the eastern edge of Edmonton will bea new build, not a retrofit of existing infrastructure, according to Imperial Oil public and government affairs manager Keri Scobie.

“We expect there will be approximately 600 direct construction jobs throughout the course of the project, plus hundreds of other jobs through our various partners that we will get in place as the project progresses,” Scobie said to Global News.

Renewable diesel fuel — sometimes called green diesel — is a biofuel that can be produced from a range of sustainable feedstocks including wood, crops and vegetable oils, and even sawdust.

Because it is chemically the same as petroleum diesel, renewable diesel can be used in regular diesel engines. That makes it appealing for companies racing to get in line with Canada’s new Clean Fuel Standard, which takes effect next year.

 

The legislation will require liquid fuel suppliers to decrease the carbon intensity of their products by 13 per cent by 2030.

“We’re not alone in this. Everybody’s looking at renewable diesel as being an advantaged fuel under the Canadian clean fuels regulation coming forward, and we certainly see it the same way,” Wetmore said.

Imperial’s proposed project will use “blue” hydrogen (a term used to describe hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage) to process locally grown crops such as canola, soybeans and camelina into the renewable diesel.

“This is a first of its kind for the company and something we’re extremely excited about,” Scobie said.

The company didn’t disclose a price tag for the proposed project, saying it intends to make a final investment decision next year. Production could start in 2024.

Wetmore said moving ahead with the complex will depend on market conditions as well as securing necessary government approvals and support.

He said Imperial is in partnership discussions with the governments of Alberta as well as with B.C., which has its own provincial renewable and low carbon fuel requirements.

While most of North America’s major renewable diesel complexes are located in the United States, plans are also in the works to build one at Regina.

That project, proposed by Federated Co-operatives Ltd., would be built at the company’s existing Co-op refinery site and has a 2025 production target. It would be similar in size to the one proposed by Imperial.

Amanda Stephenson,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017,"With global climate change threatening to wreak havoc on their industry, insurance companies are increasingly looking to limit their exposure to the fossil fuel sector.

“This was not an issue that was central in the insurance sector, even 7 years ago,” said Robin Edger, national director of climate change for the Insurance Bureau of Canada. “But now it is moving at light speed.”

In the past three years, 23 major global insurance companies have adopted policies that end or limit insurance for the coal industry, and nine insurers have ended or limited insurance for the Canadian oilsands.

Other insurance companies are making changes on the asset side of their books, divesting fossil fuel investments and adding green energy to their investment portfolios. In July, eight of the world’s largest insurance companies — including Swiss Re, Zurich Insurance Group and Aviva — committed to transitioning their portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The “sustainable finance” movement — which seeks to use the power of investment capital to move toward a lower-carbon economy — also includes pension funds, banks, and mutual funds. But of all the institutional investors, insurance companies have perhaps the most on the line when it comes to climate change.

According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the average annual cost of claims for property damage or losses due to severe weather has more than quadrupled over the last decade to $2.4 billion in 2020. That figure is expected to keep growing. An alarming report from the United Nations earlier this month said the world will cross the 1.5-degree-Celsius warming mark in the 2030s, resulting in more floods, fires and heat waves.

On the hook for more payouts amid ever-escalating risk, the global insurance industry has been lobbying for years for governments to take more action on climate change. But it is only recently that insurers have begun taking a critical look at their own investments in fossil fuel companies.

In Europe — where the disclosure of fossil fuel investments is mandatory for public companies — insurers are moving faster than their North American counterparts, said Victor Adesanya, lead author of a recent DBRS Morningstar report on the topic.

But even in the U.S. and Canada, where the disclosure of fossil fuel holdings is not required, the issue is gaining momentum, Adesanya said. Manulife Financial, for example, has committed to assessing its own $411-billion portfolio with the goal of getting to net-zero by 2050.

“For them (North American insurers) to just turn off the taps and stop investing right away, I don’t see that happening,” Adesanya said.

“But there’s a trend that has started, and it will begin to ramp up.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""But there's a trend that has started, and it will begin to ramp up.""

Environmental groups are also increasingly putting pressure on the insurance industry, demanding that they stop underwriting coal mines, coal-fired power plants, and other fossil fuel projects. They have had some success — a handful of global insurers stated publicly this year they would not provide coverage to the TransMountain pipeline expansion.

“To me it illustrates a real shift in the sector,” said Mary Lovell, who leads insurance campaigns for the San Francisco-based environmental group Rainforest Action Network. “These insurers understand the reputational risk of being involved with a project as contentious as TransMountain, as well as the material risk of constructing a new pipeline during a climate crisis.”

Edger, with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said the industry will be closely watching the COP 26 UN Climate Summit in Glasgow in November, where the issue of sustainable finance is expected to be a major topic.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LLP said it’s confident its hostile bid for Calgary-based Inter Pipeline will be successful now that Pembina Pipeline Corp. has terminated its own rival offer.

Brookfield’s $16-billion offer is now “the sole transaction on the table” for Inter Pipeline shareholders and any delay in accepting it would not be in shareholders’ best interests, Brookfield spokeswoman Claire Holland said.

“We believe Inter Pipeline’s board made the right decision,” Holland said in an email.

“This decision implicitly affirms the merits of our offer, which provides superior value, flexibility and certainty.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""This decision implicitly affirms the merits of our offer, which provides superior value, flexibility and certainty.""

Pembina announced Monday it had terminated its bid for Inter Pipeline after its board advised it would no longer recommend shareholders support the deal. Pembina will pocket a $350-million break fee as a result.

 

The news came nearly two months after Inter Pipeline entered into a friendly $8.3-billion all-share deal with Pembina equal to $19.45 per share.

The deal — which would have seen Inter Pipeline shareholders receive half a Pembina share for each Inter Pipeline share they hold — was struck in response to the hostile takeover bid from Brookfield that Inter Pipeline said undervalued its business.

Brookfield, Inter Pipeline’s largest shareholder, subsequently raised its cash and share takeover offer to $19.75 per share, up from its earlier proposal valued at $16.50 per share. It later revised the offer by giving shareholders the option to receive their entire payment in cash, instead of a mix of cash and shares, if they desire.

Brookfield again raised its offer in mid-July to $20 in cash or 0.25 of a Brookfield Infrastructure share for each Inter Pipeline share, with a cap on the number of shares that are available.

At least two prominent shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended that Inter Pipeline investors reject the company’s proposed sale to Pembina and instead support the takeover by Brookfield.

On Monday, Pembina CEO Mick Dilger said he was disappointed with the outcome.

 

“The industrial logic of a combined Pembina and Inter Pipeline remains unparalleled and the value creation between certain of our assets is impossible to replicate by any other entity,” he said in a news release.

Dilger said the company will continue to seek opportunities for growth through “focused acquisitions.”

“Pembina remains optimistic about its future, including the profitability of our existing business given foreseeable sector tailwinds, as well as with tremendous flexibility to pursue an ever increasing and more diverse set of opportunities for growth, some of which we were able to highlight and advance during this process.”

Inter Pipeline said it is open to working with Brookfield to reach a “mutually agreeable transaction.” The Brookfield offer expires on Aug. 6.

Earlier this month, the Alberta Securities Commission ruled in favour of Inter Pipeline and Pembina in a decision that was critical of the tactics used by Brookfield Infrastructure in the takeover fight.

The securities regulator upheld a $350-million break fee that Brookfield had sought to have cancelled.

It said Brookfield Infrastructure used “abusive” tactics in its attempt to buy Inter Pipeline and ordered the company to provide additional disclosure related to total return swaps it holds that give it economic exposure to Inter Pipeline’s shares.

 

The regulator also raised the minimum tender conditions of the Brookfield Infrastructure offer to 55 per cent from a simple majority of the shares tendered by shareholders other than Brookfield and those acting in concert with it."

The Alberta government is taking 50 per cent ownership of the controversial Sturgeon Refinery by paying $825 million to reduce tolling costs at the facility northeast of Edmonton.

The province has signed a restructuring deal that also extends the length of Alberta’s processing contract with the refinery by 10 years, to 2058.

The deal means less taxpayer risk in the long-term and it won’t cost the province any more than it was already obligated to pay as a toll payer, the province said Monday.

The government-owned Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission has a contract to provide bitumen to the refinery.

Under the terms of the new deal, the province will pay North West Refining $425 million for its 50 per cent equity stake in the refinery and will pay Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which will continue to own the other 50 per cent of the refinery, $400 million.

 

As a result of making the payments now, the province will not have to pay approximately $1 billion in tolling payments over the next 30 years. It will also get to play a decision-making role in the refinery’s operations.

In a news release, Energy Minister Sonya Savage said the restructuring will benefit Albertans in the long run.

“We are taking action to get a better deal for taxpayers and reducing long-term costs. This agreement provides more economic certainty which will benefit Albertans today and into the future,” Savage said.

Construction was completed on the $9.7-billion Sturgeon Refinery in the fall of 2017 and it was to begin processing as much as 80,000 barrels per day of heavy bitumen in early 2018 after starting up with partly upgraded synthetic crude from oilsands mines.

However, it did not begin processing until 2020 after two years of delays, blamed mainly on equipment failures.

A report from Alberta’s Department of Energy said the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission had a $2.68-billion net loss last year due primarily to “onerous” tolling contracts with the Sturgeon Refinery.

Kathleen Ganley, energy critic for Alberta’s NDP Opposition, called for more details of Monday’s equity agreement to be immediately released.

 

“Albertans should be deeply concerned that Jason Kenney has made them part-owners of one of the most notorious Conservative boondoggles in Alberta history,” Ganley said in a release.

Bob Weber,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017,"Most of Alberta’s energy wells no longer hold enough oil and gas to pay for their cleanup and the public should take them over to ensure their remaining revenue funds remediation, a new report concludes.

“It is a radical idea,” said Regan Boychuk of the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, which produced the report. “It is something akin to nationalization.”

Using data from the Alberta Energy Regulator released under Freedom of Information legislation, the report estimates the overall cleanup cost for the province’s 300,000 unreclaimed wells at somewhere between $40 billion and $70 billion — a figure that doesn’t include infrastructure such as pipelines or pumping stations.

The Disclosure Project, which has followed the issue for years and has advised academics and government, concludes there may not be enough value left in the ground to fund the work.

Story continues below advertisement

The same data set from the regulator suggests that 80 per cent of Alberta’s operating wells no longer hold enough oil and gas to pay for their own remediation. It also says that by the regulator’s own standards, 49 per cent of oil and gas companies licensed by the regulator are insolvent, their assets outweighed by liabilities.

Still, those companies retain wells that pump and generate revenue. The report suggests the creation of an agency that would step in on insolvent companies, operate whatever wells remain and use the proceeds to fund remediation.

Boychuk points to the example of Trident Exploration, which collapsed in 2019 leaving more than 4,000 unreclaimed wells. He said those wells were still pumping the equivalent of 10,000 barrels of oil a day.

Instead of being sold to pay creditors, the report says a reclamation trust could have taken over those wells and used the revenue to clean up the sites and create reclamation jobs.

“A reclamation trust would make lemonade out of lemons like Trident,” Boychuk said.

Such an agency could create as many as 10,000 jobs across the province, using skills Albertans already possess, he said.

Instead, Boychuk said, the public is paying. Between government grants to fund reclamation, unpaid taxes and outstanding lease payments to landowners, the report says Canadians subsidize energy cleanup to the tune of $4.3 million a day.

“Polluting companies must pay for their own cleanup,” Boychuk said. “It’s the law.”

Richard Wong, operations manager for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, suggested the report’s analysis is too pessimistic. He said capital investment in oil and gas is expected to increase during 2021 — “a signal that the industry is on the road to recovery,” he wrote in a statement.

“Accelerating the decommissioning and reclamation of inactive wells and associated sites remains a priority for our industry. We continue to work with the Alberta government to advance policies and regulations which ensure substantial progress.”

Thomas Schneider, a professor of accounting and finance at Ryerson University who advised on the report, said Alberta needs to do something as liabilities mount and the resource dwindles.

“In Alberta today, the regulator only collects a deposit from a company when it’s deemed to be insolvent. This is absurd. We need to collect cleanup costs before a company becomes insolvent.”

He said oil and gas companies should have to report all their cleanup liabilities.

In an email, Energy Minister Sonya Savage said the government has already moved to ensure wells get reclaimed.

Story continues below advertisement

She said companies now face a tighter evaluation of their ability to meet environmental obligations when they buy wells. The role of an industry-funded group that looks after wells for which no owner exists has been expanded.

As well, the government is introducing a new program to encourage producers to require companies to spend a certain percentage of their environmental liabilities on well cleanup each year.

Savage has said that figure could be four per cent. It remains unclear how the program would be administered or enforced.

“The report… falls short on a number of points and completely fails to reflect the significant progress made by Alberta’s government on addressing a number of issues it identifies,” Savage wrote.

She said the reclamation trust suggested in the report would expose Alberta taxpayers to unnecessary risk.

“Implementing a public reclamation trust would create a significant risk with Alberta taxpayers having to assume the cost of liabilities.”

Two Ojibwe bands and three environmental groups sued the Corps in federal court late last year. They claimed the Corps did not properly evaluate the pipeline’s impact on climate change, and that the agency should have conducted its own, full environmental impact study on the pipeline instead of relying on the state’s. Their lawsuit also alleges that the Corps failed to fully consider treaty rights. The pipeline crosses lands where several tribes claim treaty rights to hunt, gather and fish.

The Corps asked for the case to be dismissed, saying the agency met all requirements under federal environmental law. The permit allows Enbridge to drill beneath certain rivers during construction and discharge dredged material.

Since Biden took office in January, opponents of Line 3 have repeatedly called for him to stop the project. The most practical legal way for him to do that would be by revoking Line 3’s Army Corps permit, or by ordering that the permit to be redone.

“Today’s decision is the Biden administration on autopilot, defending a Trump water permit for a massive tar sands pipeline that is actually indefensible,” said Andy Pearson, an organizer with MN350, a climate change group.

"Twinkle Ghosh,David Akin",Global News,11/28/2017,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologized to the chief of a First Nation in Kamloops, B.C. for not taking part in that community’s National Day of Truth and Reconciliation ceremony despite being in Tofino last Thursday.

The prime minister telephoned Tk’emlúps Nation Chief Rosanne Casimir and offered her an apology yesterday, Trudeau’s office said Sunday. He also discussed the path forward and told the chief that he hopes to visit her community soon.

The First Nation community had twice invited Trudeau to mark Canada’s first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation with them but the prime minister flew to Tofino, B.C., on Sept. 30 and spent part of it vacationing with family.

Global News filmed the prime minister walking along a beach.

The Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the vacation in a statement sent to Global News last Thursday.

“Yes the PM is spending time in Tofino with family for a few days,” Trudeau’s spokesperson wrote.

“And, following his participation in last [Wednesday] night’s ceremony marking the first National Day for Truth & Reconciliation, he is speaking today with residential school survivors from across the country.”

Trudeau’s trip sparked criticism from Indigenous leaders who said it was disrespectful of him not to attend events honouring survivors.

In an interview with The West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson Sunday, National Chief RoseAnne Archibald of the Assembly of First Nations said that the government’s “words and actions have to be aligned.”

“They talk about being committed to our children and the path forward. Yet they fought us in court for years, they fought our children in court. So you can’t do two things at the same time,” Archibald said.

“When the prime minister talks about reconciliation, please, don’t go on a holiday on the very first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Participate in an event on the day, not the day before. That would be more in alignment with his real commitment to reconciliation.”

Trudeau has yet to visit the burial site of the former Kamloops residential school, where as many as 215 unmarked graves were discovered earlier this year.

The findings set off weeks of mourning across Canada. It saw hundreds of tiny shoes and stuffed animals placed near the Centennial Flame on Parliament Hill as well as at other sites around the country to honour the lives of the children who never came home from residential schools.

Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) said the prime minister’s actions were a “slap in the face” to the families of residential school victims.

“The prime minister has spoken on many occasions about the need for reconciliation and said that it was a priority with this government,” Phillip said.

“Yet when he’s faced with the prime opportunity to demonstrate national leadership on this issue, he arrogantly turns his back on Indigenous children and goes to Tofino for a holiday.”

Trudeau doesn’t have “any respect,” Said Phillip. “He’s completely consumed by his own arrogance and his delusional sense of self-importance.”

Joan Bryden,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017,"Last June, 33 Canadian senators voted to defeat a motion decrying China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims as a genocide.

While they all faced criticism from some quarters, only one – Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, leader of the Independent Senators Group – seems to have been singled out as an alleged stooge of China’s communist regime, told to resign and “go home.”

Last week, Woo got a similar reaction when he tweeted about the release of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, the two Canadians arbitrarily detained by China for nearly three years in retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the United States.

Woo tweeted that it was a “happy day” for the families of the Canadian men who became known around the world as the “two Michaels” and for Meng, who was simultaneously released and allowed to return to China. He urged Canadians to ponder the lessons learned from the affair.

He attached a link to an op-ed published in the Toronto Star that cited a former U.S. ambassador, Chas Freeman, saying that the “U.S., assisted by Canada, took Meng hostage in the first place as part of its trade-and-technology war with China.”

That earned Woo a scathing rebuke from Chris Alexander, a former diplomat and one-time immigration minister in Stephen Harper’s Conservative government.

“By claiming Meng was ‘taken hostage’ by Canada, @yuenpauwoo has violated his oath as a Canadian senator and should resign,” Alexander tweeted.

“Mouthpieces for foreign propaganda … should have no place in Canada’s Parliament,” he added.

Alexander’s tweet was shared by others who variously referred to Woo as “pond scum” and a “Chinese commie f—” who should be “sent back to China along with Meng.”

China has maintained from the outset that Meng’s arrest was politically motivated. Canada and the U.S. have strenuously denied it but plenty of American and Canadian experts nevertheless share Freeman’s view that she was a political bargaining chip.

That view was fuelled by former U.S. president Donald Trump, who was attempting to negotiate a trade deal with China at the time of Meng’s arrest and who said he’d intervene in her extradition case “if I think it’s good for what will be the largest trade deal ever made.”

John Manley, a former Liberal deputy prime minister and Canadian foreign affairs minister, said at the time that Trump’s comments had “given Ms. Meng’s lawyers quite a good reason to go to the court and say, ‘This is not an extradition matter. This is actually leverage in a trade dispute and it’s got nothing to do with Canada.”’

Woo notes that Manley and others who have echoed similar views have not been denounced as mouthpieces for China.

That’s a specific kind of opprobrium, he believes, meant to stigmatize people of Chinese descent and he’s worried about where the rising tide of anti-Asian sentiment in Canada could lead.

“I am Exhibit A, if you will, only because I have a bit of public profile,” Woo said in an interview.

“But there are many others in the community who do not have my protections and are genuinely fearful of the increasing typecasting and stigmatization that’s going on.”

He has been accused of being unabashedly “Beijing friendly,” a mouthpiece and lobbyist for the Communist Party of China, even though he points out he’s “three generations removed from the mainland (China).”

He fears recent immigrants from China, who still have connections to family there, are considered even more suspect and are less able to defend themselves.

Woo points to reports suggesting that Chinese Canadians might have been influenced by or acting on the behest of China when they voted in last month’s federal election, resulting in the defeat of several Conservative incumbents who had advocated a hardline stance against Beijing.

“This is really a slanderous and dangerous way of thinking because it makes assumptions about Chinese Canadians ? who have views that may not be mainstream (and) it presumes that they are not able to think for themselves,” he said.

“The accusation that they are foreign agents or stooges of the Chinese government is a very, very serious allegation and, of course, hearkens back to the days of McCarthyism when careers were ruined and lives were lost and we have to be very careful not to go back to that place.”

One of those defeated Conservative MPs, Kenny Chiu, who lost his B.C. riding to a Liberal in the Sept. 20 election, told The Canadian Press that during the campaign there were WeChat posts he says contained false information about the Conservatives and allegations a private member’s bill he tabled would discriminate against Chinese Canadians. But he also said his party could have done a better job speaking directly to members of that community.

When Woo spoke against the motion labelling China’s treatment of Uyghurs a genocide last June, he argued that Canada, given its history of forcing Indigenous children to attend residential schools, should not try to lecture China from a position of moral superiority on human rights.

Rather, he said, Canada should appeal to its Chinese “friends” not to make the same morally wrong and societally damaging mistake of trying to repress and forcibly assimilate a minority group.

Sen. Peter Harder, the former government representative in the Senate who now sits with the Progressive Senate Group, made a similar argument.

Sen. Peter Boehm, a former senior Global Affairs bureaucrat and Sherpa for prime ministers at G7 summits, argued that the motion’s “few paragraphs of what passes for megaphone diplomacy” would accomplish nothing, other than to anger China and possibly hurt attempts to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor.

Boehm, a member of the Independent Senators Group, said in an interview that both he and Harder got “a few brickbats” for their speeches, including from his former colleague, Alexander.

Alexander could not be reached for comment in time for publication.

“What I was getting was ‘You’re an experienced diplomat, you should know better, shame on you.’ That was basically what I was getting from Chris Alexander and from others who consider themselves experts,” Boehm said.

But unlike Woo, he said: “No one has tweeted or commented that I should go back to China.”

Boehm agrees with Woo that “there’s a correlation here with anti-Asian racism on the rise in Canada and some of this is permeating into the utterances or what various Canadians who should know better are putting on their social media feeds.

“I think it’s unfair and demeaning.”"
Rachel Gilmore,Global News,11/28/2017," 

It usually starts with a message: “Hey hun!”

The sender has a friendly tone. They pepper their messages with pet names. Maybe it’s a friend, a distant cousin, or someone you haven’t spoken to since high school.

But the real reason for their message becomes clear when they finally ask: have you ever wanted to be your own boss?

That was the kind of message Anna Lange, who lives in Missouri, had been turning down for months. But then COVID-19 hit. Lange had an 11-month old baby at home. The self-described workaholic had become a stay-at-home mom after having just graduated college. She was living in a new city. She was lonely, and she wanted to help her husband by bringing home some extra cash.

She said yes. And today, Lange is still recovering from it financially and emotionally.

The business opportunity she pursued was with a multi-level marketing company, also known as an MLM. She paid to buy products to sell. She paid for marketing materials. But the sales just didn’t come. By the time the dust settled, Lange was about US$5,000 in debt.

And she wasn’t alone. Industry data shows participation in direct selling — the umbrella term for the sales industry that includes MLMs — grew by 20 per cent in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

“I saw a lot of recruitment posts, ‘because it’s COVID, people are working from home,’ they’re like, ‘now’s the perfect time to join in because we’re going to have this boom,’” Lange said.

“They told me when I signed up, ‘you can just sell the products and you will be able to make a full-time income doing that.’”

But despite the promises made to people like Lange, more than 80 per cent of participants in the direct selling industry make less than 10 per cent of their household income from this work.

 

“Realistically, I would say that probably five per cent or less of the people doing direct selling in Canada make a full-time wage or something near that,” Peter Maddox, the president of the Direct Sellers Association of Canada – the industry group representing MLMs – told Global News in an interview.

On top of that, “less than one (per cent) of MLM participants profit,” according to a paper published on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission website in 2011.

It’s a lesson Lange learned the hard way.

“I fell on my face big time,” she said.

What is an MLM?

It all started with the door-to-door salesman.

Often portrayed on TV as a slick, persistent man who won’t take no for an answer, these individual sellers would march up customers’ porches and try to sell them a product.

 

That’s what direct selling is — it’s a business model where, instead of placing a product on store shelves, individual “consultants” hawk a brand to their family, friends and community.

It has a long history. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, women would hold Tupperware parties. They’d pass around the plastic containers in the comfort of their living rooms in the hopes of making a buck.

But in an MLM model, the host of that kind of party isn’t just selling the product — they’re trying to recruit an army of others to sell the goods, too. The recruiter, commonly called the “upline” gets a percentage of any sales the recruit, or the “downline,” makes.

As laws changed and society moved online, these salespeople did too. Selfies and product pictures posted on Instagram overtook these living room sales parties. Salesmen and women who might once have knocked at your door now slide into your direct messages on social media.

But their goal remains the same: sell the product and recruit a sales team. Push your sales team to recruit a sales team of their own. Rinse. Repeat. Theoretically, a recruiter could make limitless commissions from their downline of sellers.

If this sounds like a pyramid scheme, it’s because the two business models are very similar — but with one important difference: pyramid schemes have no real product and are illegal.

 

MLMs are legal because the focus is on the real, tangible products — even if the sellers can beef up their earnings by recruiting more sellers.

The recruitment

Much like Lange, Lillian Cariaga was feeling isolated in her Mississauga, Ont., home when she received the message from a friend in June of 2020.

“It just felt nice to reconnect with someone outside of my household,” Cariaga said.

The friend mentioned she had been exploring a new business opportunity. She was working from home.

Eventually, Cariaga, a single mother at the time, opened up about her financial struggles.

“That’s where the hook was,” Cariaga said.

The friend went all-in. She told Cariaga how much money she had made in her first few months with the company. The opportunity, she said, had “changed her life.”

 

Eventually, the friend invited Cariaga onto a Zoom call with other moms who were part of the MLM. That’s when Cariaga caved.

“It just felt nice to be part of a community of moms who have similar goals,” she said. “The good feeling outweighed the red flags.”

There were quite a few red flags, according to Cariaga. She said there was a major focus on recruiting, rather than selling. She was also told to cut off unsupportive friends and family. After six months with the company, Cariaga was left to clean up the financial and physical mess she feels it may have caused.

Cariaga had been using the hair products she was selling, and one day, her partner pointed out she had a bald spot.

She was also diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that Cariaga said may have been the source of the hair loss.

Still, when she raised the hair loss with her upline – the person who recruited her — Cariaga was “appalled” by the reaction.

“I showed her a picture … and said, ‘my hair wasn’t like this when I started using this, girl.’ And then she said, ‘well, have you been using it consistently and correctly?’” Cariaga said.

 

“There was no empathy in it.”

Cariaga had also put one of her kids in daycare so she could focus on her MLM work. But she quickly realized she had miscalculated the cost of the daycare. That expense piled on to the debt she was already accumulating from working with the MLM.

“We racked up a few thousand on that, too, so I had to pick up shifts,” Cariaga said. “I was working like five days a week overnight, running on two to three hours of sleep.”

She left the MLM, but the climb back to financial stability was proving steep.

Ultimately, the stress and the lack of sleep took their toll.

“My health got affected. I was hospitalized for blood pressure issues,” she said.

 

Searching for 'pain points'

Cariaga said the tactics used to get her to join in the first place were “almost predatory.” That became even more clear to her when she was being trained to turn around and recruit more members herself.

“There was an emphasis in the calls, in the training, to emotionally connect – to emotionally connect and see where their pain points are,” Cariaga said.

“It’s all about building relationships, finding out what the pain points are, and then hooking into those pain points.”

Lange said she was pressured to use similar tactics.

“My upline was going through a miscarriage and she was like, ‘oh, we know this is really hard, but it’s bringing me people who see my story and they want to join me,'” she said.

 

“And I’m like, I don’t want anyone to join me because of that. That’s not something I want to be profiting off of.”

Her team also suggested she use her mental health issues to reach potential recruits.

“They told me .. .you could reach so many women by the fact you had postpartum depression,” Lange said.

Maddox said in a statement that the industry association does not support these kinds of tactics.

“Any statements made by independent sales consultants associated with DSA Canada member companies, which are considered to be deceptive or unethical, go entirely against what the companies commit to and stand for,” he said in a statement.

“DSA Canada member companies have comprehensive processes in place to deal with concerns from consumers and independent sales consultants, and they invite people impacted to contact them directly.”

 

The COVID-19 boom

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic became fertile ground for recruiters looking to grow their downline. Both Lange and Cariaga joined their MLMs during the pandemic, in part due to the feeling of isolation and a desire to find a community.

They weren’t alone.

As the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered businesses and forced many Canadians out of work, retail sales from direct selling grew by 26 per cent, according to the Direct Selling Association of Canada. In 2020 alone, the number of Canadians that signed up to sell for these companies rose 20 per cent from the previous year, the association said.

MLMs tend to thrive at times when the broader economy is struggling, Maddox admitted.

“When economic indicators aren’t as great, there is a little bit of a pick-up in terms of people who are active in direct selling,” he said.

 

“Some people just sign up because they want to get discounts on the product … but the people who do have signed up with the intent of sales … that definitely, that does go up at that point.”

1:52 Why direct sales appeals to so many moms Why direct sales appeals to so many moms – Mar 5, 2019

Lange said her husband was able to work from home during the pandemic, but she felt “super guilty” after leaving the MLM, because she spent the U.S. stimulus checks on the business.

“Any sort of sale that I made went back into the business. It was buying marketing materials. It was buying samples for people who wanted to try the product,” she said.

“It really took a hit to our finances.”

Lange and her husband had plans to buy a house before she joined the MLM.

 

“Obviously, that didn’t happen because of the housing market. But like, we can’t even get an apartment right now because we’re still paying off credit card debt from my time with the company,” she said.

“And that’s really hard. And I feel really guilty about that.”

Is this legal?

In Canada, there are laws in place to protect sellers like Lange and Cariaga.

The recruiter can’t force the seller to buy more product — product the recruiter makes a commission from — than they could possibly ever sell. They also have to have a reasonable “buy-back guarantee” or a refund policy, so you can send back your extra product if you ever leave the gig.

Recruiters also can’t misrepresent how much money there is to be made.

 

But with so many individual sellers sending so many direct messages to so many people, Maddox acknowledged that it can be a heavy lift to ensure everyone is complying.

“Honestly, it keeps our member companies up at night,” Maddox said. “I’ve visited some of our member companies, most of them are based in the U.S. … They’ll have a whole floor of their building that is the compliance department.”

There are people, Maddox said, who “scrub all their consultants’ social media accounts” in a bid to find out if anything is being misrepresented.

“There are strict rules in the U.S. and Canada about making income claims, about making product claims,” he said.

But in the last five years, the Competition Bureau told Global News it has not laid a single charge against a multi-level marketing company.

When the Bureau does find evidence of potentially illegal activities, it said it “does not hesitate to take action.”

“The Bureau is determined to crack down on those who use deceptive marketing practices to steal Canadians’ hard-earned money,” said Marie-Christine Vézina, a spokesperson for the Competition Bureau.

 

“We strongly encourage Canadians who suspect deceptive marketing practices to file a complaint on our website.”

Still, one lawyer said that while the laws are there, “in terms of actual enforcement, I see virtually none.”

Toronto-based lawyer Steve Szentesi, who specializes in competition, antitrust and advertising law, used to regularly advise MLM companies about the legal framework for setting up in Canada. He did that work for more than a decade.

“I have not seen a significant appetite for compliance with Canadian laws over the last 10 years,” he said.

2:06 New warning about old pyramid scheme New warning about old pyramid scheme – Feb 28, 2018

Part of the problem, according to Szentesi, is that there are both federal and provincial laws that companies and direct sellers have to abide by — and many of these laws are “pretty opaque and highly factual.”

 

Provincial and territorial laws, Szentesi said, largely lay out obligations for the individual direct sellers. The broader MLM companies, however, have to comply with both those provincial and federal laws.

“The main obstacle I have found has just been – for sellers and operators and even the courts, in some cases, and the enforcers – to distinguish between legal and illegal,” he said.

“If consumers are thinking about joining an MLM plan and have some concerns, they should get competent legal advice.”

Moving on from an MLM

Lange remembers how much the tone shifted in the messages she received from her MLM colleagues after she made it clear she wanted to leave.

When she joined, she said, they told her she could work “as little or as much as you want” without needing to sign a contract.

 

“But when you leave, it’s ‘you’re not working hard enough. You didn’t do what I told you to. You’re not coachable.’ And the tables get turned so quickly when you are not putting the dollar signs in their pockets,” Lange said.

And while Lange didn’t form a tight-knit bond with the team that promised her community when she felt isolated — most of them lived out of town — she was still iced out by them after leaving.

“They all unfollowed me on Instagram. They all unfriended me on Facebook,” she said. “Except for the main upline, she’s the one who hasn’t, but I think it’s because our husbands are friends.”

 

Cariaga had a similar experience. Her MLM team had held training about how to handle unsupportive friends and family, and one instructor said she stopped seeing her best friend of almost 10 years because of the MLM.

Cariaga said she had come close to cutting off her best friend, too, who raised concerns about her new line of work. That was a red flag, she said.

Now she doesn’t really talk to anyone from the MLM.

“I felt like I lost that drive that I had, the connection with people that were outside of my family, just that sense of direction,” she said, “because that vision that I had of building something for my family – it was gone.”

On top of that, she said, she “felt very ashamed” about getting involved with the MLM.

“I was beating myself up,” Cariaga said.

But after speaking to the best friend she almost lost and finding an online community of others who had left MLMs, she found a new community that helped her cope.

“I thought, ‘OK, I’m not alone in this whole recovery,'” she said.

As Cariaga looks to the future and tries to heal the mental and financial wounds from her time spent with an MLM, she has a message for anyone who is thinking of joining one.

 

“Be very careful. Don’t fall in too deep, if you do decide to go,” she said.

“And the moment you start to feel like your family is turning on you, remember who loved you first.”"
Michael Liedtke And Jonathan Mattise,The Associated Press,11/28/2017,"Hundreds of world leaders, powerful politicians, billionaires, celebrities, religious leaders and drug dealers have been hiding their investments in mansions, exclusive beachfront property, yachts and other assets for the past quarter-century, according to a review of nearly 12 million files obtained from 14 firms located around the world.

The report released Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists involved 600 journalists from 150 media outlets in 117 countries. It’s being dubbed the “ Pandora Papers” because the findings shed light on the previously hidden dealings of the elite and the corrupt, and how they have used offshore accounts to shield assets collectively worth trillions of dollars.

The more than 330 current and former politicians identified as beneficiaries of the secret accounts include Jordan’s King Abdullah II, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ecuador’s President Guillermo Lasso, and associates of both Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The billionaires called out in the report include Turkish construction mogul Erman Ilicak and Robert T. Brockman, the former CEO of software maker Reynolds & Reynolds.

Many of the accounts were designed to evade taxes and conceal assets for other shady reasons, according to the report.

“The new data leak must be a wake-up call,” said Sven Giegold, a Green party lawmaker in the European Parliament. “Global tax evasion fuels global inequality. We need to expand and sharpen the countermeasures now.”

Oxfam International, a British consortium of charities, applauded the Pandora Papers for exposing brazen examples of greed that deprived countries of tax revenue that could be used to finance programs and projects for the greater good.

“This is where our missing hospitals are,” Oxfam said in a statement. “This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is `no money’ to pay for climate damage and innovation, for more and better jobs, for a fair post-COVID recovery, for more overseas aid, they know where to look.”

The Pandora Papers are a follow-up to a similar project released in 2016 called the “Panama Papers” compiled by the same journalistic group.

The latest bombshell is even more expansive, porting through nearly 3 terabytes of data — the equivalent of roughly 750,000 photos on a smartphone — leaked from 14 different service providers doing business in 38 different jurisdictions in the world. The records date back to the 1970s, but most of the files span from 1996 to 2020.

In contrast, the Panama Papers culled through 2.6 terabytes of data leaked by one now-defunct law firm called Mossack Fonseca that was located in the country that inspired that project’s nickname.

The latest investigation dug into accounts registered in familiar offshore havens, including the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles, Hong Kong and Belize. But some of the secret accounts were also scattered around in trusts set up in the U.S., including 81 in South Dakota and 37 in Florida.

Some of the initial findings released Sunday painted a sordid picture of the prominent people involved.

For instance, the investigation found advisers helped King Abdullah II of Jordan set up at least three dozen shell companies from 1995 to 2017, helping the monarch buy 14 homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. One was a $23 million California ocean-view property bought in 2017 through a British Virgin Islands company. The advisers were identified as an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands.

There was no immediate comment from Jordan’s Royal Palace.

The details are an embarrassing blow to Abdullah, whose government was engulfed in scandal this year when his half brother, former Crown Prince Hamzah, accused the “ruling system” of corruption and incompetence. The king claimed he was the victim of a “malicious plot,” placed his half brother under house arrest and put two former close aides on trial.

U.K attorneys for Abdullah said he isn’t required to pay taxes under his country’s law and hasn’t misused public funds, adding that there are security and privacy reasons for him to have holdings through offshore companies, according to the report. The attorneys also said most of the companies and properties are not connected to the king or no longer exist, though they declined to provide details.

Blair, U.K. prime minister from 1997 to 2007, became the owner of an $8.8 million Victorian building in 2017 by buying a British Virgin Islands company that held the property, and the building now hosts the law firm of his wife, Cherie Blair, according to the the investigation. The two bought the company from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister, Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani. Buying the company shares instead of the London building saved the Blairs more than $400,000 in property taxes, the investigation found.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis both said they didn’t initially know the other party was involved in the deal, the probe found. Cherie Blair said her husband wasn’t involved in the purchase, which she said was meant to bring “the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.” She also said she did not want to own a British Virgin Islands company and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company,” which is now closed.

In 2009, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis put $22 million into shell companies to buy a chateau property in a hilltop village in Mougins, France, near Cannes, the investigation found. The shell companies and the chateau were not disclosed in Babis’ required asset declarations, according to documents obtained by the journalism group’s Czech partner, Investigace.cz.

A real estate group owned indirectly by Babis bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau in 2018, the probe found.

“I was waiting for them to bring something right before the election to harm me and influence the Czech election,” Babis tweeted in his first reaction to the report.

Fakiha Baig,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017," 

A Saskatchewan woman who is worried about losing her eyesight or possibly dying because her surgery for a rare cancer was cancelled in Alberta says the operation has been quickly rescheduled for next week.

Sharon Durham said she learned late Friday afternoon that the surgery is set for next Thursday in Edmonton. She had been told earlier in the week it was off, she said, because she’s not an Alberta resident and the province’s hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.

Durham said she was overwhelmed with joy and relief to learn the surgery will now happen.

“This one is basically going to get rid of the cancer and reconstruct (my nose),” she said.

“I still want my story out there just because I’m not the only one going through this.”

 

Durham, 54, said she was driving to the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton from her farm near Wynyard, Sask., on Monday when she received a call and found out the 18-hour surgery she was to have the next day for invasive cancer in her nose and under her eyes was cancelled.

“The cancer has already spread down to the corner of my left eye, so (the doctor is saying), ‘You’ll probably be losing your eyesight.’ I can deal with that but, if it goes into my brain, I can’t deal with that and neither can my family.

“That’s game over.”

Last month, Alberta Health Services announced non-essential surgeries were being cancelled as hospitals and intensive care capacity were filled beyond normal limits because of the province’s crippling fourth wave of COVID-19.

A spokesman for the health provider said Friday that it is postponing surgeries that don’t need to be performed within a three-day window, which is about 75 per cent of all surgeries.

“We are still doing urgent, emergent and prioritized cancer surgeries. We are doing all we can to complete as many cancer surgeries as possible,” said spokesman Kerry Williamson.

 

Alberta Health Minister Jason Copping said in a statement that his office received a message from Durham’s family.

“The minister is deeply sorry to patients whose care is being disrupted by the extreme pressure on our ICUs, including Albertans and patients from other provinces,” it said.

“We’re doing everything we can to get through this crisis as soon as possible and get back to providing normal care.”

Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, has said a majority of patients in intensive care units have COVID-19 and are unvaccinated.

Last week, Saskatchewan suspended its organ donation program due to a lack of staff and intensive care beds — also consequences of the pandemic.

Durham said she can’t have the surgery in her home province because no one is specialized enough.

She’s scared and angry that Alberta hospitals are prioritizing the health of unvaccinated individuals who are now sick.

“We’re just so angry with people not getting vaccinated,” she said in tears. “I have family who’s not getting vaccinated. I told (them) right out: ‘It’s because of you and all the other unvaccinated why I’m in this position right now.”’

In April 2020, Durham had a 23-hour surgery to remove cancer in her nose. A surgeon then reconstructed her nose with the help of a screw. She had three more surgeries after that.

 

Last May, her doctor in Saskatchewan booked an appointment for her to see an Edmonton surgeon to have the screw removed, Durham said.

Three months passed without a call, but she wasn’t too worried, she said.

“It looked like it was getting infected, so (the doctor) wanted to take that screw out… but (he) was pretty sure there was no cancer.”

She was finally able to book a consultation in August. When the surgeon saw her, he told her the cancer had returned.

Last Saturday, she was told to prepare for her next surgery. Then it was cancelled.

Durham said she called local members of the legislature every day to try to connect with someone who would listen. Her Edmonton doctor also sent emails arguing her case.

“Just from reading the lab reports… it’s growing quite fast,” she said.

“My (mind’s) been so busy that I really haven’t had a chance to sit and really think about it, and I try not to because I don’t want to die.”

Durham said the surgeon’s office is to contact her again on Monday to go over the plan for next week’s operation and what to expect.

 

Doctors are to remove the cancer, remove the remainder of her nose and begin to reconstruct it.

The national chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) has criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to go on a holiday on the same day Canada marked its first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation to honour lost children and survivors of residential schools.

Trudeau had received at least two invitations from Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc, a British Columbia First Nation that discovered the remains of up to 215 children at a residential school site in Kamloops earlier this year, to spend the day with survivors and their families on Sept 30.

Instead, he took a trip to Tofino, B.C., where Global News filmed the prime minister walking on a beach.

In an interview with The West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson Sunday, National Chief RoseAnne Archibald of the Assembly of First Nations said that the government’s “words and actions have to be aligned.”

 

“When the prime minister talks about reconciliation, please, you know, don’t go on a holiday on the very first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Participate in an event on the day, not the day before. That would be more in alignment with his real commitment to reconciliation.”

Archibald, who is the first woman to serve as AFN national chief, said the prime minister’s decision to not attend a ceremony hosted by Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc was “very hurtful for survivors and intergenerational trauma survivors.”

Even though Trudeau participated in a ceremony on Parliament Hill in Ottawa the night before the first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation, many Indigenous leaders have sharply criticized him for not attending events honouring survivors on the actual day.

On Saturday, Trudeau telephoned Tk’emlúps Nation Chief Roseanne Casimir and offered her an apology. In a statement to Global News Sunday, the prime minister’s office said he also discussed the path forward and told the chief that he hopes to visit her community soon.

Earlier this year, the federal government designated Sept. 30 as a federal statutory holiday to give Canadians a chance to reflect on the legacies of the residential school system, colonial policies and the cultural genocide of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.

However, Indigenous community members say it should not be treated as a holiday, but rather a day of remembrance and reflection. A number of events and ceremonies were organized across the country.

An estimated 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and Metis children attended residential schools between the 1860s and 1996. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented stories from survivors and families and issued a report in 2015.

 

The report details mistreatment at the schools, including the emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children, and at least 4,100 deaths.

Trudeau has yet to visit the site of the former Kamloops residential school, where as many as 215 bodies were discovered earlier this year at a burial site near the school.

Archibald, who belongs to the Taykwa Tagamou Nation in Ontario, urged Trudeau to visit Casimir, her council and community.

“That would have been the ideal place for him … as we marked the very first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.”

In a tweet Sunday evening, Archibald added a call for media outlets to give as much coverage to survivors’ stories as they did on Trudeau’s trip to Tofino.

Let’s remember that Truth and Reconciliation is about Survivors and those children who died in the institutions of assimilation and genocide,” said Archibald.

Therefore, I ask media outlets to give as much time to Survivors’ stories as they are giving to the Prime Minister’s behaviour on September 30.”

Poll finds 1 in 3 British Columbians haven’t been asked for vaccine passport as they should have"
"Gene Blevins, Jonathan Allen",,11/28/2017," 

A large oil spill off the southern California coast left fish dead, birds mired in petroleum and wetlands contaminated, prompting local officials to call it an environmental catastrophe.

The U.S. Coast Guard, heading a clean-up response involving federal, state and city agencies, said on Sunday there was an around-the-clock investigation into how the spill occurred.

An estimated 126,000 gallons, or 3,000 barrels, had spread into an oil slick covering about 13 square miles of the Pacific Ocean since it was first reported on Saturday morning, said Kim Carr, the mayor of Huntington Beach, at a press conference.

She called the spill an “environmental catastrophe” and a “potential ecological disaster.” The beachside city, about 40 miles (65 km) south of Los Angeles, was bearing the brunt of the spill.

 

Carr added: “Our wetlands are being degraded and portions of our coastline are now covered in oil.”

The spill was caused by a breach connected to the Elly oil rig and stretched from the Huntington Beach Pier down to Newport Beach, a stretch of coast popular with surfers and sunbathers.

Carr said the oil rig was operated by Beta Offshore, a California subsidiary of Houston-based Amplify Energy Corporation. Calls to Beta and Amplify went unanswered.

Carr, in her remarks, added: “In the coming days and weeks we challenge the responsible parties to do everything possible to rectify this environmental catastrophe.”

Amplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher said at a press conference in Long Beach that the pipeline had been shut off and remaining oil suctioned out. He said divers were still trying to determine where and why the spill occurred.

U.S. Representative Michelle Steel, a Republican representing part of the affected area, sent a letter to Democratic President Joe Biden requesting a major disaster declaration for Orange County, which would free up federal funds to help with the clean-up efforts.

 

Steel later told CNN: “This is a really serious disaster.”

Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democratic state assembly member representing some areas affected by the spill, said she had “huge concerns” about the extent of the damage to the environment, communities and local economy.

She told CNN the spill was a “call to action that we need to stop drilling off our precious California coast.”

Oil production off California’s coast has declined sharply since its peak in the 1990s, in part due to the state’s strict environmental rules. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said he wants to end oil drilling in the state by 2045.

Offshore drilling was restricted in the state after a devastating 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara that dumped 80,000 barrels into the ocean. More recently another spill off Santa Barbara in 2015 sent as much as 2,400 barrels onto the shore and into the Pacific.

Oceana, an ocean conservation group, also called for an end to offshore oil and gas drilling.

Jacqueline Savitz, Oceana’s chief policy officer, said in a statement: “This is just the latest tragedy of the oil industry. It’s well past time to prevent future oil spills by permanently protecting our coasts from offshore drilling.”

The spill occurred in federal waters. Officials said federal, state and city agencies were involved in a response headed by the U.S. Coast Guard.

On Sunday, Orange County supervisor Katrina Foley said the oil had infiltrated the Talbert Marsh, a large ecological reserve, causing “significant damage.”

Beaches were closed to swimming and a local air show was canceled, although some people were undeterred from setting up chairs on the beach to enjoy a sunny Sunday or strolling along the pier.

Carr said officials had deployed 2,050 feet (625 meters) of protective booms, which help contain and slow the oil flows.

The U.S. Coast Guard, working with local and state agencies, flew airplanes to assess the spill and had hired contractors to clean it up.

 

Officials said they were investigating the cause of the spill and the type of oil involved.

But with the battle over masking now in the rearview mirror, pressure is mounting on the next potential dispute concerning COVID-19 safety in the classroom: mandatory vaccination for staff.

On Friday, the New Westminster school district voted to seek legal advice on the possibility of a mandate, with a report on the idea expected next Tuesday.

Six B.C. school district parent advisory councils, including Vancouver, Surrey and Burnaby, have also signed a letter to the provincial government calling for mandatory vaccination for teachers and staff.

“If we ask for it as well, and we show the fact that we support it as well as parents, perhaps that will give the indication to the minister of health to call on the teachers to have mandated vaccines,” Surrey District Parent Advisory Council President Rina Diaz said.

Mike McCullough, an advocate with the BC Safe Schools coalition, would like to see the mandate go even further.

“I think anybody who’s eligible should be mandated to vaccines,” he said. “Not only for staff but for eligible children as well.”

The BC Teachers’ Federation has maintained that it would not oppose a vaccine mandate for members, though said any such requirement would need to protect privacy and offer accommodations for staff who can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.

Asked about the idea Friday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry appeared to suggest that if a mandate was imposed, it wouldn’t come in the form of an order from her office.

“My responsibility under public health orders is to look at those highest risk environments that are in the health system. So that’s what I am focusing on from public health orders,” she said, adding that she was supportive of employers having their own requirements in risky settings.

“It is an employer-employee relationship in many other settings, and we are seeing increasingly that employers are requiring vaccination in many different settings and school settings are no different.”

It’s not clear exactly how many teachers are vaccinated, but the union says a strong majority of staff have been immunized.

The divide between those who have had the jab and those who haven’t may start hitting close to home in Manitoba as new COVID-19 rules target gatherings involving unvaccinated people.

The new public health orders, which go into effect Tuesday, Oct. 5, mean some families will have to decide between a large Thanksgiving dinner with a fully vaccinated group or a smaller turkey dinner with an unvaccinated guest.

Luckily, Gerald McMillan won’t have to make that call as everyone on his guest list has already had two shots.

“Everybody’s double vaccinated, everybody’s raring to go,” he said.

Ken Dufault, who is hosting Thanksgiving at the cabin, said he wasn’t planning on getting together with unvaccinated guests, regardless of what the province says. He and his wife have only been attending events where vaccination is a requirement.

 

“People that aren’t vaccinated know that they’re not going to be attending any type of event at our place,” he said.

Dufault said he hasn’t received any pushback from the people he’s had those conversations with.

Megan Delmonte, however, is dreading the uncomfortable conversations.

Although she would like to see all her friends and family sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine, she understands some will not listen to her and it’s not in her personality to exclude people from social gatherings.

“It’s hard,” Delmonte said. “You kind of get stuck in the middle.”

Her boyfriend, Adriane Dizon, added that he doesn’t want anybody to “feel left out.”

Under the new rules, indoor household gatherings will be limited to guests from one other household when an unvaccinated person who is eligible for the shots is on the property.

Households will also be limited to 10 guests outdoors when an unvaccinated person who is eligible is present.

“This is going to be very challenging to enforce, it will be challenging for friends and family to have these kinds of conversations,” Winnipeg epidemiologist Cynthia Carr said.

 

Carr isn’t convinced everyone will be eager to follow the orders.

“I’m challenged to believe that people will necessarily follow these rules,” she said.

“If there are reasons that people are not vaccinated that include mistrust of government, not believing the virus is real, not understanding the risks involved — it would be challenging for me then to think that that group of people would then be a) open to the conversation of disclosing their vaccine status, or b) really worry that much about it.”

Carr said it’s unfortunate that new restrictions are being implemented at a time when vaccines are widely available, but all available strategies need to be considered to contain the fourth wave."

Annie Slight has been battling breast cancer for the past eight years.

Since her diagnosis in April 2013, the Montreal resident has undergone 16 treatments of chemotherapy, bilateral mastectomy, a full hysterectomy and two reconstructive surgeries. Although now in remission, she still has two more years of hormonal drug therapy to go.

It has been ordeal that could’ve been prevented if she was diagnosed earlier, Slight says.

“If I had been given the proper screening, additional to the mammogram, the cancer would have been found at least a year and a half earlier. So that’s a long time for cancer to progress,” the 51-year-old who works in special education told Global News.

 

Slight got her first mammogram at the age of 40, which came back clear. However, what she wasn’t told at the time, was that she had dense breasts, which not only puts women at an increased risk of breast cancer, but cancer is more difficult to detect with a standard mammogram.

Slight’s case is not unique. A new survey by non-profit Dense Breasts Canada showed that 30 per cent of women who had a mammogram were not informed of their breast density. That survey was part of a report published on Sept. 27 ahead of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Currently in Canada, six provinces – British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island – add density information to mammogram results. In five other jurisdictions – Ontario, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador – women only in the highest density category are given that information by radiologists.

 

Ontario mom Nicola St. George was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2019 – a year and half after her first mammogram, which did not detect anything at the time. She too wasn’t informed that she had dense breasts.

George only decided to get screened again after finding a lump while doing a self-exam lying in bed one night.

“I do think that women need to know that they have dense breasts because you should have follow-up mammograms and you should also do self-exams,” the 43-year high school teacher told Global News.

“It’s really just my own luck that I decided to do a self-exam and actually found it and followed through with my instincts.”

Experts say “inconsistencies” in breast screening practices are putting women at risk and many are being turned away from screening because of the “outdated guidelines.”

 

According to the Dense Breasts Canada survey, in which 2,530 women participated, 42 per cent of respondents were unaware of the eligible age for mammography screening – which varies by province.

Ideally, all women should have an annual mammogram starting at 40 years, because the risk of breast cancer increases at that age, said Dr. Paula Gordon, a breast radiologist in Vancouver and a clinical professor at the University of British Columbia.

“Although it’s less common for younger women to get breast cancer, when they do get it, it grows faster and it spreads faster, so we want to catch breast cancers early in younger women.”

And those with dense breasts should be offered supplemental screening, either with an ultrasound or MRI, she said.

Late diagnosis

Dr. Jean Seely, the head of breast imaging at the Ottawa Hospital, advised that high-risk women should start getting screened even earlier in their 30s.

 

In Canada, only four jurisdictions – British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Yukon – let women book their own mammogram in their 40s. Elsewhere, a requisition by a physician is required, but there is concern as many women are being refused.

“Unfortunately, I hear probably every week about a woman who was asking for her health-care provider to refer her for a mammogram in her 40s and was unable to get in because of the guidelines,” said Seely, who is also the president of the Canadian Society of Breast Imaging.

It’s a worrying trend seen across the country that is leading to late diagnosis and women losing lives from breast cancer, she told Global News.

4:30 Breast Cancer Awareness Breast Cancer Awareness – Sep 24, 2021

The survey showed that 11 per cent of respondents, aged 40-49, indicated that they were denied a requisition for a mammogram by their health-care provider.

 

The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, which issues national guidance, conditionally recommends against mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49, who are not an increased risk.

“If women in this age group wish to be screened, they should have a discussion with their health-care provider to decide if screening is best for them,” according to the guidelines that were updated in 2018.

There are no recommendations for screening over the age of 74.

Seely said this “falsely reassures” women that they won’t get breast cancer when they’re in their 40s or in their late 70s.

“What we find … is that women who are in those two age groups – in the 40s and older in the 70s – are the ones that are presenting … with a later-stage diagnosis.”

Raising awareness

Gordon said the guidelines were based on old research done 30 to 50 years ago and should take into consideration more recent data.

 

She pointed to a 2014 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, including 2.8 million Canadian women, that found that those who have mammograms starting at age 40 were 40 per cent less likely to die of breast cancer than women who don’t have mammograms.

Gordon stressed there was a great need for education of women and physicians as to what the optimal breast screening practices are.

“Women need to know that it’s OK to be assertive and advocate for what you need.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""Women need to know that it's OK to be assertive and advocate for what you need.""

There are also various myths around breast cancer and screening.

A common misconception is that women don’t need to worry if there’s no history of breast cancer in the family. Both Gordon and Seely dismissed that claim.

 

In fact, more than 75 per cent of women with breast cancer have no family history of the disease, according to the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

Going forward, better communication and greater investment of resources will be needed, said Seely.

“I think that we need to really focus on this as a health-care priority, because losing a woman’s life doesn’t just affect the woman, it affects the whole community and the family.

“So it’s a health-care issue for all of us.”

Health Canada says GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is recalling two lots of its “Advil Cold & Sinus Day/Night Convenience Packs” after a packaging error left the daytime caplets labelled as nighttime caplets and vice versa.

GSK says the labelling error is located on the back of its 18 and 36 caplet boxes, with the foil on the products’ blister pack “rotated upside down and misaligned.”

“Consumers may take a nighttime caplet instead of a daytime caplet, and vice versa. Taking a nighttime caplet when alertness is required may pose health risks,” the recall stated.

Health Canada says to immediately stop using the recalled items and to consult a health care professional if they’ve used the product and have any concerns.

 

According to the agency, the affected products were shipped across Canada starting in July of 2021.

“The nighttime caplets contain an antihistamine medicinal ingredient (chlorpheniramine maleate) that can cause drowsiness,” read Health Canada’s warning.

“Taking a nighttime caplet when alertness is required may pose potentially serious adverse health consequences, such as when driving motor vehicles or operating heavy machinery. It may also cause potentially serious health consequences for those who have taken other sedatives or tranquilizers, consumed alcohol, and the elderly.”

Health Canada said that the daytime and nighttime caplets differ from one another in shape and colour. The daytime caplet is beige and marked by “ADVIL COLD & SINUS” while the nighttime is orange and marked by “Advil A/S.”"

It’s Sunday, October 3rd, and this is The West Block.

Hello, I’m Mercedes Stephenson. Thank you for joining us on the show.

2021 has been a year of reckoning for Canadians when it comes to the treatment of Indigenous people in this country and the devastating impact of residential schools.

More than 1,300 children were found in unmarked graves earlier this year. Survivors say there are thousands more graves to be found.

Thursday was the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, encouraging Canadians to pause and reflect on the impact that colonialism has had on Indigenous Peoples. Ceremonies were held across the country including in Kamloops, where 215 unmarked graves were confirmed at a former residential school earlier this year.

Joining us now to talk about this is Assembly of First Nations (AFN) National Chief RoseAnne Archibald. National Chief Archibald, thank you so much for joining us today. It’s the first time we’ve had the opportunity to speak with you since you were elected as the national chief. A very important day for Indigenous Canadians this week with the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, what did it mean to you and to your family?

Story continues below advertisement

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: It was a really difficult day, and it’s a difficult day for survivors. And we have many survivors still who are alive and living in communities, and it’s a difficult day for them because they become re-traumatized and, you know, they have to deal with some complex emotional fallout from being in those institutions of assimilation and genocide. And so I spent the day up here in the interior of B.C. at Tk’emlups te Secwepemc—was invited by Chief Rosanne Casimir in the summer—promised her that I would come back for this honouring of survivors and intergenerational trauma survivors and so I was really happy to be able to come up here for the day.

In terms of my family, though, just to continue, I do have—I did share a personal story on my social media and I also shared it at the event and, you know, this is not ancient history. Eight members of my immediate family, including my parents and my siblings, went to institutions of assimilation and genocide. I don’t call them schools anymore because no school that I ever went to had a graveyard. I was the first of my family to not be forced to attend and so I want people to know that even though this was over 100 years of government policy that created these institutions, the last one closed in 1996, which wasn’t that long ago.

Mercedes Stephenson: It is astounding, and it is something that so many Canadians think happened 100 years ago. No. This was still something happening into the 1990’s. There are still so many survivors who are young and are still with us. You mentioned the ceremony in Kamloops. Chief Casimir had also invited the prime minister to attend. He was speaking with residential school survivors but he also went on vacation to Tofino with his family on the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation. What was your reaction to his decision?

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: This has always been, I would say the difficult part of creating this kind of statutory holiday, is that people will see it as a holiday and they’ll focus on the idea of a holiday when really what we need people to do on the day was to stand with us, you know, to have solemn ceremonies and prayers, and stand shoulder to shoulder with survivors and take that time to reflect on the fact that genocide has happened here in Canada. And so when you go on a holiday, on that particular day it’s very hurtful for survivors and intergenerational trauma survivors.

Mercedes Stephenson: Have you had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister about that decision?

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: No. I—you know, I’ve repeatedly tried to connect with—when I was the Ontario Regional Chief, I had the cell number of the premier. I think a lot of people did, but he answered my calls regularly and I don’t have that access to this prime minister. I keep asking for it so I’m hoping that over time he will share his cell number with me so that I can communicate with him in these urgent matters. You know like it’s really difficult to have to go through all of his staff to get messages back and forth. And so, you know, what I would say is there are two standing invitations from Tk’emlups te Secwepemc to come to their community, which is the first site that we recovered 215 of our little children, and I urge him to go and visit [00:06:06] Rosanne Casimir, her council and her community. And that would have been the ideal for him on—yesterday as we marked the very first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.

Story continues below advertisement

Mercedes Stephenson: Are you concerned about what that lack of direct access means in terms of commitment to sincerity on reconciliation or are you confident on the government’s position on that?

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: Well there’s a lot of, you know, double-talk with this government. They talk about being committed to our children and the path forward, yet they fought us in court for years. They fought our children in court. So you can’t do two things at the same time. I mean, you have your words and actions have to be aligned. So when the prime minister talks about reconciliation, please, you know, don’t go on a holiday on the very first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Participate in an event on the day, not the day before. That would be more in alignment with his real commitment to reconciliation.

The other thing that I noticed that the prime minister doesn’t say a lot is he doesn’t talk about truth and reconciliation. And there has to be truth before reconciliation. You know, the truths are really hard and they’re harsh. The fact that these were institutions of assimilation and genocide, and the fact that genocide did happen in Canada and our little children were the victims of that, those are truths that this government and all of us have to face together, but not to just stand there and sort of, you know, not move forward. We have to find what we are calling the healing path forward and that’s my hope with this prime minister and cabinet, is that there will be a consistency in their approach. So if they say they’re committed to reconciliation then walk the path of healing with us. For example, I just saw that in the U.S. they are starting a new commission called the Commission for Truth and Healing and I think that’s a little more of an apt charm for what we need to do in this country. It’s—it’s about healing. Reconciliation has to be a focus on healing not only for First Nations, but for all Canadians, non-Indigenous Canadians as well.

Mercedes Stephenson: National Chief, we also just saw the results of the coroner’s inquest into Joyce Echaquan’s death in Quebec, talking about systemic racism as a factor. How would you like to see that addressed and what did you think of the coroner’s report?

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: I haven’t had an opportunity, Mercedes, to read it in detail. But I do want to just say that many of our people are afraid to go to hospitals and to see medical professionals because they do encounter overt, covert and systemic racism in the health care system and that has to change. The health care system is about care. Care is a key word there. And another word that we really need to start utilizing more is love and care. So for example, when a person is seeking medical attention, they need the love and care of those health practitioners and that’s what we have to infuse into the system and ensure that when we go to seek health care that we feel safe and that we have culturally appropriate mechanisms, trauma informed care. There’s a lot to uncover and unpack in that coroner’s report, undoubtedly, and I’m looking forward to being able to talk to it a little bit more later.

Mercedes Stephenson: Love and undeniably important for us, as well as truth and a very difficult one for Canadians that we have to face. Thank you so much for joining us today, National Chief. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.

RoseAnne Archibald, AFN National Chief: Thank you, Mercedes. Take care.

Up next, climate activists give world leaders a failing grade ahead of a major UN climate conference. We’ll talk to the federal environment minister about Canada’s plan to meet its emissions targets.

Story continues below advertisement

[Break]

Mercedes Stephenson: All talk and no action is how Greta Thunberg describes efforts by world leaders to fight climate change.

Greta Thunberg, Climate activist: “Right now, we are still very much speeding in the wrong direction. 2021 is currently projected to experience the second highest emissions rise ever.”

Mercedes Stephenson: Thunberg was speaking in Milan where government ministers from around the world are meeting ahead of the UN’s major climate conference in Glasgow taking place in November. They’re trying to resolve issues around a $100 billion fund promised to help developing countries to further fight climate change.

Federal Environment Minister and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, is involved in those talks and he joins me now from Milan. I am very curious to know how those talks around the $100 billion were going. This is a pot of money that’s designed to help developing countries who don’t have the same resources as countries like Canada to try to transition their economies. One of your big tasks going into this was to get everyone to cough up the money. Were you able to get the $100 billion?

Story continues below advertisement

Jonathan Wilkinson, Environment and Climate Change Minister: Well you’re right. This is a critical piece in the Paris architecture. It is important for the developing world to see that the developed world is delivering on the commitment to $100 billion. Growth in that funding has slowed and so Germany and Canada was asked to corral the money in advance of COP. We have been spending a lot of time over the last couple of months doing that, and certainly the last couple of days we’ve been meeting with a lot of countries to twist their arms about being more ambitious to respect to climate finance. I would say that I am cautiously optimistic that we are going to be able to deliver on that when we get to COP, but of course there’s still a bit more work for us to do over the coming days.

Mercedes Stephenson: And of course, there’s work here at home, too. Your government has been re-elected. You made some pretty substantial promises in your platform on environment, as you have in previous elections as well. One of them being that you would get emissions down even further than you’d promised. Initially, it was 30 per cent reduction by 2030. You’re now saying a 40-45 per cent reduction, but your government’s record on this isn’t great. If you look back from 2015 until now, emissions have gone up consecutively every single year. They have not gone down. So how are you going to not only prevent them from going up further but actually reduce them?

Jonathan Wilkinson, Environment and Climate Change Minister: So I would dispute your characterization, Mercedes. Our track record is actually very strong. When we took over in 2015 after a decade of Stephen Harper doing zero on climate, the emissions for Canada in 2030 were projected to be somewhere around 15 per cent higher than they were in 2005 and the commitment was to be 30 per cent below. So the first thing we did was put in place a series of measures, some of which take time to implement, which broke the trajectory and we are now 1 per cent below where we were in 2005. We actually provided a detailed climate plan that showed how we would meet the 30 per cent number, and then we brought forward a more ambitious target and including the commitments we made in the platform. The experts in this country, including people like Professor [00:03:17 last name], who modeled it, say we will hit that target. We of course, have work to do to implement all those measures. But I would say our record on climate is very strong and to be honest with you, that’s one of the reasons why the international community tasked Canada to lead with Germany on this issue around the $100 billion.

Story continues below advertisement

Mercedes Stephenson: And I think to be fair, yes, you’ve taken a large number of environmental initiatives, but I just want to be clear. Are you disputing that emissions have gone up since 2015 that they’ve not gone down because that is what all the environmentalists are saying. We’re the only country in the G7 that hasn’t managed to reduce our emissions.

Jonathan Wilkinson, Environment and Climate Change Minister: No, what I’m saying to you is when we took power the trajectory was straight up in terms of where the emissions were going. We actually have bent the curve such that right now, emissions are 1 per cent lower than they were in 2005 and we have a long way to go, obviously, to get to 40-45 per cent below, but we’ve changed the trajectory of the curve. That’s what you have to do to start. And we actually have developed, perhaps the most detailed climate plan in the world that experts say, will achieve the target.

Mercedes Stephenson: Minister Wilkinson, you’ve talked about capping oil and gas, which obviously is a very large emissions producer in Canada. It’s also still a very large employer in a large part of our economy. How do you cap emissions on that and support the economy at the same time. What does your plan look like?

Jonathan Wilkinson, Environment and Climate Change Minister: So that’s a really good question. You have to think about the transition from both an environmental perspective and an economic perspective. Canada, as other countries in Europe and elsewhere, see the economic opportunities associated with being an early mover to address the climate issue, but that means we have to think about economic diversification. It means we need to think about the transition in terms of the kinds of things that you can utilize in provinces that have been large hydrocarbon producers. So we put in place, for example, the $2 billion fund to incent the development of a [00:05:06] industry. We’re very interested in the development of hydrogen in the context of different provinces across the country and so it’s really about being thoughtful about diversification of economies and about, of course, providing appropriate kinds of skills training to allow workers to transition. But at the end of the day, we are facing an existential threat. It’s not a question of whether we reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s about how we do it. And we have said, we have to be thoughtful on the economic side and we have to take steps. We have to ensure it’s a transition, unlike the New Democrats who think somehow you can turn the lights off, you know, tomorrow. That’s not the way this works. As somebody who worked running clean tech companies for almost 20 years, I have a really strong appreciation for that. But you have to make progress and I will tell you at COP, people see Canada as a climate leader. I will tell you just off the side, there was enormous relief at COP that it was impressed to me by a number of folks that the Conservative Party did not win the election because no party, no party to the Paris agreement has rolled back a climate target. They would go in the exactly the opposite direction of where we need to go as a world and people are very happy to see our government return to office.

Mercedes Stephenson: Happy and I’m sure looking forward to further progress that you can make on some of those promises. We’ll certainly be chatting about them on the show. Thank you for joining us today, minister.

Jonathan Wilkinson, Environment and Climate Change Minister: Thank you very much.

Mercedes Stephenson: Up next, Saskatchewan struggles to get its COVID cases under control. Will new rules lead to more vaccinations? We’ll get an update from that province.

[Break]

Mercedes Stephenson: Welcome back to The West Block. In Saskatchewan, the per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases is more than triple the national average and this week saw a death rate of four times the national average. Surgeries are being postponed and the province’s organ donor program is suspended.

On Wednesday, Health Minister Paul Merriman, was asked if there is a crisis. Here’s what he had to say.

Story continues below advertisement

Paul Merriman, Saskatchewan Health Minister: “The word crisis can mean different things to different people, but it’s certainly an extremely challenging time. I’m hearing this directly from the doctors, sometimes indirectly from the doctors.”

Mercedes Stephenson: Joining us now is Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority. That’s the body responsible for health care delivery in the province. She is also a doctor in the ICU.

Dr. Shaw, you will actually be travelling after we speak to you on the show to look after patients who are in the absolute most critical state. Can you describe for our viewers what the situation you’re seeing is with your patients right now in Saskatchewan and in the province more broadly?

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: Well Mercedes, we continue to see increased numbers of people presenting with severe life-threatening COVID each and every day, not just in Saskatoon where I am but all across our province. Our ICUs are surging. We’re beyond our usual capacity. We’re doing everything we can to make sure that people get the best care they can regardless of what type of illness they have. But it is a real struggle.

Mercedes Stephenson: I know that governments have been hesitant to use words like crisis or emergency. How would you describe the situation?

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: Well I do think we’re in a crisis. We’ve been facing increased numbers for weeks now and I don’t see an end coming in the near future. We are watching closely. We’re watching to see what’s happening in Alberta with their rates of infections and what’s happening in their hospitals and we’re not yet seeing a plateau there or a plateau in Saskatchewan which gives me much hope. Like you said, our organ donation program is suspended because we’ve had to redeploy the staff. We have adults admitted to our pediatric intensive care units. We have hundreds of patients, if not thousands who’ve had their surgeries and planned procedures cancelled so that we can focus on taking care of people who are already infected with COVID and trying our best to even further prevent infections by interrupting the spread.

Mercedes Stephenson: And how do you do that at this point? Do you think that there needs to be a stay-at-home order? What are the public health steps that you would like to see the province take?

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: Well medical health officers made, about a month ago, a set of recommendations to our chief medical health officer and elected officials and I think the situation has changed significantly since then because we’re even seeing even more daily numbers, which are people with infections presenting for care. And I think what we do need to strongly consider at this point, and I leave this in the hands of government, is reducing the sizes of inside gatherings. I think we need to go even further in making sure that vaccines are accepted and necessary to go into as many places as possible. And I do think that there’s an opportunity here to slow things down so that the system can at least plateau and then hopefully get into recovery mode.

Mercedes Stephenson: The government is now bringing in some documentation on vaccines. Do you think that it’s too little too late?

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: I think it’s an important step. Today is our first day that the proof of vaccination policy is in place across the province and I’m grateful for that. I have travelled recently for a personal reason into a neighbouring province where it was in place a month ago and it was such a relief and wonderful to see a restaurant at capacity where everybody was safe and protected. And so I look to it being successfully implemented in our province, and I think it needs to be expanded as well.

Mercedes Stephenson: Why do you think there’s so much hesitancy in Alberta and Saskatchewan? And I’m originally from Alberta, you know, before we saw Ontario and Quebec with surge and Alberta and Saskatchewan would surge in other provinces. This really seems to be localized between these two provinces in the fourth wave being so high. What do you attribute that to?

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: I’m not sure if I have all the answers to that. Certainly, there’s been a lot of analysis. I think what we’ve seen, though, at least in my province, is a strong desire by the public and by government to have a summer that felt as normal as possible. And despite some signals that were—that we were seeing early on that the Delta variant caused havoc in other parts of the world, I think there was a sense that that wasn’t going to happen here. Unfortunately, it has happened here. We’ve seen that the information that came out of the U.K. that was used in Alberta didn’t set that province on the right path and I think Saskatchewan has been looking at similar jurisdictions to learn from and adapt their policies. Saskatchewan is a strong province, though. We have about 1.2 million people that do tend to come together in moments of crisis and I really remain hopeful that we will continue to do that.

Mercedes Stephenson: Dr. Shaw, we send our best to you and to the people of Saskatchewan. Thank you for making time for us today.

Dr. Susan Shaw, Chief Medical Officer Saskatchewan Health Authority: Thank you, Mercedes. Stay safe.

Mercedes Stephenson: We requested an interview with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney but both declined.

That’s our show for today. Thanks for watching. We’ll be right back here, next Sunday. I’m Mercedes Stephenson, for The West Block.

David Lao,Global News,11/28/2017,"Canada’s environment minister says he’s “cautiously optimistic” that he, and his German counterpart, will be able to convince enough countries to help fund a $100-billion climate change pledge ahead of the rapidly approaching U.N. climate talks in Scotland next month.

Speaking with The West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson, Jonathan Wilkinson said that the fund, which is specifically earmarked to help developing countries fight climate change, was a “critical piece” in the Paris Accords’ architecture.

According to Wilkinson, both Canada and Germany agreed to help corral the money in advance of the 2021 United Nations climate conference, also known as COP26, after funding for the program had slowed.

“We have been spending a lot of time over the last couple of months doing that, and certainly the last couple of days were meeting with a lot of countries to twist their arms about being more ambitious with respect to climate finance,” said Wilkinson, who at the time had spent several days in Milan for the conference’s final set-up in agenda.

“I would say that I am cautiously optimistic that we are going to be able to deliver on that when we get to COP. But of course, there’s still a bit more work for us to do over the coming days.”

On Friday, Wilkinson said that both Canada and Germany were making “a lot of progress” in their efforts and that he had spent the last two days in Milan in a series of bilateral meetings with some of the world’s most powerful and richest countries.

More than 10 years ago, those same nations had collectively agreed to raise $100-billion in climate financing a year by 2020 in order to help fund the developing worlds’ efforts to adapt and mitigate against climate change.

Story continues below advertisement

Last month, the OECD revealed that those developed countries were US$20 billion short of that $100-billion goal — and with those wealthy nations producing a majority of the emissions responsible for destabilizing the planet’s climate and warming it at an increasingly rapid rate — Wilkinson and Germany’s environment state secretary Jochen Flasbarth both agreed to help get them to cough up the cash.

“I would say that we have made a lot of progress and certainly Germany and Canada are working very hard to ensure that we can and we will deliver on the $100-billion commitment,” said Wilkinson on Friday during a telephone news conference from Milan.

Luckily for Wilkinson and Flasbarth, some of that gap had been bridged before taking up their efforts in July to round up the money in July.

Canada promised to double its funding to $1 billion a year over the next five years and Germany committed to at least US$7 billion by 2025.

U.S. President Joe Biden had also fulfilled his promise to rejoin the Paris Agreement — an agreement former president Donald Trump backed out of, ending U.S. climate financing.

Biden however said he’d double the U.S. contribution to the fund by 2024, earning praise from Wilkinson who added that the financial commitment was “critical” for them to hit that $100-billion goal.

A report documenting what has been promised so far and how Wilkinson and Flasbarth intended to get the rest is expected to be published later in October.

David Lao,Global News,11/28/2017,"As Saskatchewan’s rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to hit record-breaking numbers, the chief medical officer of the province’s health authority says that she doesn’t see an end to their health-care crisis coming “in the near future.”

The comments from Saskatchewan Health Authority Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw, who spoke with The West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson, come just days after the province’s health minister expressed hesitancy at describing their health-care situation as a crisis or emergency, despite the province seeing a per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases three times the national average and a death rate of four times the national average.

“The word crisis can mean different things to different people, but it’s certainly an extreme, challenging time. I’m hearing this directly from the doctors, sometimes indirectly from the doctors,” said Health Minister Paul Merriman on Wednesday after being asked whether there was a crisis.

In response to whether there was an emergency in the province, Shaw laid it out plainly: “I do think we’re in a crisis.”

Shaw pointed to the province’s ICUs surging beyond usual capacity, forcing adults to be admitted to pediatric intensive care units usually reserved for children, as well as the suspension of hundreds of surgeries and procedures and the province’s organ donor program.

“We’re doing everything we can to make sure that people get the best care they can, regardless of what type of illness they have. But it is a real struggle,” said Shaw.

“We’ve been facing increased numbers for weeks now and I don’t see an end coming in the near future.”

Health officials in Saskatchewan tallied another 480 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, as well as another eight people who have died after contracting the virus.

A total of 239 patients are in-hospital receiving care while another 67 are in ICUs.

On Friday, a new proof-of-vaccination or negative test result policy went into effect across Saskatchewan, requiring residents to provide either of those in order to access several businesses or locations in the province.

On whether the new proof of vaccination policy had come too little, too late, Shaw expressed optimism in its implementation but added that it left room for it to still be expanded.

When asked about what needs to be done next by the province, Shaw pointed to a set of recommendations sent by her and other medical officers to the province’s chief medical health officer and elected officials.

“I think the situation has changed significantly since then because we’re seeing even more daily numbers, which are people with infections presenting for care,” said Shaw, who urged the government to consider reducing the size of indoor gatherings.

“I think we need to go even further and making sure that vaccines are accepted and necessary to go into as many places as possible. And I do think that there’s an opportunity here to slow things down so that the system can at least plateau and then hopefully get into recovery mode.”"
Alan Cross,Global News,11/28/2017,"This movie is late. Very late. If there hadn’t been a pandemic, the 25th JamesBond film, No Time to Die, would already be on VOD if not running on premium cable. The original release date in November 2019 was pushed to February 2020 because of production issues. When that didn’t happen because of the departure of director Danny Boyle, it was postponed to April 2020. But then COVID-19 hit — and well, we know that story.

The good news is that we’re getting No Time to Die slightly earlier than we thought. With improvements in the COVID-19 situation, the release dates of Nov. 12 (U.K.) and Nov. 25 (the rest of the world) were pushed up to Sept. 30 (U.K.) and Oct. 8 (everyone else). That’s a long wait for a movie that started production in 2016 and cost US$300 million to make.

This, however, gives us another chance to look back at all the title theme music that has come with every Bond film over the last 60 years. Here they are in chronological order.

Story continues below advertisement

1. Dr. No (1962)

The first theme for a Bond movie was … the iconic James Bond theme. Composer Monty Norman actually plagiarized himself, taking the key elements of a song he wrote called Good Sign Bad Sign, which is sung by Indian characters on the island of Trinidad in a musical based on a book called A House for Mr. Biswas. You’ll hear it immediately.

Monty moved the melody to a twangy guitar and presented it to the producers — who hated it. Trying to salvage what they could, they gave the music to producer John Barry who gave it an orchestral arrangement. BOOM! A theme for the ages.

Known simply as The James Bond Theme, it has appeared in every single Bond film. The last I heard, Monty Norman is still cashing royalty cheques at the age of 94.

2. From Russia With Love (1963)

The Norman/Barry Bond theme figured large in the second film with an instrumental backing the opening titles. But buried in the film and the closing credits was the first song written just for a Bond film. It came from Matt Munro, an English singer in the style of Frank Sinatra.

3. Goldfinger (1964)

This was the first Bond film to have a bespoke song over the opening title sequence and the first to use the title of the film in lyrics. John Barry, who would be synonymous with Bond films for decades, got help from Anthony Newley, a British song-and-dance man greatly admired by a young David Bowie. The singing job was given to Shirley Bassey, a Welsh theatre actress, even though Harry Salzman, one of the producers, absolutely hated the song. I quote from a note sent back to Barry and Newley: “That’s the worst [expletive] song I’ve ever heard in my [expletive] life!” But with no time to come up with an alternative, the song stayed in the movie. And it became a worldwide top 40 hit.

4. Thunderball (1965)

Barry decided to mine Wales again, returning with Tom Jones. Still not very rock’n’roll, but hey. The music industry was a very conservative business back then.

5. You Only Live Twice (1967)

Sensing that they might be on to something by drafting in well-known singers, the producer hired Nancy Sinatra (daughter of Frank). A slightly different version ended up being released as a radio single, but moviegoers heard this.

Story continues below advertisement

6. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969)

After five films, Sean Connery wanted out so the producers hired George Lazenby. John Barry wrote something wordless for the opening sequence. However, jazz great Louis Armstrong was also brought for a secondary theme called We Have All the Time in the World.

7. Diamonds Are Forever (1971)

When Lazenby didn’t cut it as 007, Sean Connery agreed to return for the Las Vegas-themed Diamonds Are Forever. Also returning was Shirley Bassey singing a proper song over the opening title sequence — which by this time had become extraordinarily elaborate things.

Story continues below advertisement

8. Live and Let Die (1973)

After Diamonds, Connery was out for good (well, not quite — but as far as the official Bond canon was concerned, he’d had his last mission). With Roger Moore stepping into the role, it was time for a re-think of what to do with the title music. Producer Harry Salzman wanted Shirley Bassey again but co-producer Albert Broccoli had another idea. “Let’s rock it up,” he said, “And we’ll do it with a Beatle.”

Broccoli sent Paul McCartney a copy of the script. He liked it very much and agreed to write the theme. He had it done in a week between sessions for his Red Rose Speedway album. The recording took place at AIR Studios, the George Martin-owned facility above Oxford Circus with Martin producing, making this the first time he’d worked with a Beatle since their breakup in 1970.

Story continues below advertisement

When the demo was done, Martin went to Broccoli and Salzman and said, “Look, we’ve got a very good theme song for you. But the only way you’re going to get it is if you let Paul do it. Otherwise, go get someone else for your little movie.”

With time running out, Salzman and Broccoli caved. And despite some of the most tortured grammar ever committed to tape — “In this ever-changing world in which we live in” (McCartney mean to say “in which we’re living,” which makes more sense, but it didn’t come out that way), the result was the best Bond theme ever. I don’t even want to argue about it.

9. The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)

You’d think that with the global success of Paul McCartney and Wings’ Live and Let Die that the producers would continue down that road. Nope. For the ninth movie in the franchise, they harried a Scottish singer named Lulu who was briefly a hot commodity. Bad move. This was the first Bond theme not to chart anywhere. A total stiff.

Story continues below advertisement

10. The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)

The next four Bond themes were sung by women. Carly Simon was hired to sing a major key(!) power ballad(!!!) written by Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager. This was the first Bond theme since Dr. No to have a different title than the movie (to be fair, though, “the spy who loved me” does show up in the lyrics. The only thing that kept this song from hitting number one on the Billboard singles chart was Debbie Boone’s You Light Up My Life.

11. Moonraker (1979)

Shirley Bassey returned for the third time after both Frank Sinatra and Kate Bush(!!!) declined to participate. Johnny Mathis had actually begun production on the song but couldn’t finish the project for some reason. Two versions are used in the movie, one for the opening title sequence and a disco(!!!) version over the closing credits. Both were chart stiffs largely because no one knew how to market the song and to whom. Fun fact: In 2007, an instrumental version of the song was used for promoting tourism in the Dominican Republic.

Story continues below advertisement

12. For Your Eyes Only (1981)

The first choice was Deborah Harry. But when she was told that they had no use for Blondie and had no intention of letting them write the song, she quit. Plan B was Sheena Easton, a Scottish pop superstar in the early 1980s. She was chosen to sing a title sequence track co-written by Bill Conti, the composer of the famous Rocky theme. Easton is the only performer of a title song to actually appear in the opening sequence. Oh, and the rejected Blondie song? You can find it here.

13. Octopussy (1983)

After sitting out For Your Eyes Only, John Barry was back to score the 13th film in the franchise. He co-wrote this for Rita Coolidge with Tim Rice (yes, Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s lyricist) and had everything produced by Phil Ramone. I guess it’s hard to write a lyric that rhymes with “Octopussy,” so for the second time, a Bond theme song didn’t carry the same title as the movie. All Time High was the winner out of six titles put forward. Fun fact: Bookies had bet on Laura Branigan getting the job, so the selection of Coolidge — whose career had peaked several years earlier — was a surprise.

14. A View to a Kill (1985)

With the last five theme songs drifting far into sleepy adult contemporary territory, it was time for another re-think. In 1985, Duran Duran was probably the hottest band in the world, but that’s not why they got the gig. The story is that bass player Roger Taylor drunkenly approached producer Cubby Broccoli at a party and said “When are you going to get someone decent to do one of your theme songs?” An unconventional pitch, but it worked. It probably also helped that Roger Moore was out and Timothy Dalton was in. A good time for a change, then.

Duran Duran came up with the bones of the song while John Barry hired a 60-piece orchestra. When it was released, A View to a Kill became the only Bond theme to ever reach number one on the American singles charts.

Story continues below advertisement

15. The Living Daylights (1987)

Well, that New Wave-y thing worked for A View to a Kill, so the producers went to that well again, hiring the uber-hot A-ha from Norway. It’s a co-write between guitarist Pal Waaktaar and John Barry, although the process was anything but smooth. A-ha preferred their version to what Barry produced, which they later released on their 1988 album, Stay These Roads. It was a decent-sized hit in the U.K. (#5) but a smash in Norway (#1).

16. Licence to Kill (1989)

As the Bond franchise entered its second quarter-century, John Barry decided to take a break. The reins were handed over to Narada Michael Walden, a superstar producer (Temptations, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and so many more; he’s now playing drums for Journey. No, really.) Reaching back into his love for R&B, Walden called up Gladys Knight to sing his theme. The song charted best in Europe but didn’t trouble even the lowest reaches of the American Billboard Hot 100.

Story continues below advertisement

17. Goldeneye (1995)

Almost six years elapsed between Bond films before Pierce Brosnan resurrected the role with Goldeneye. If the franchise was going to continue, it was important to pay attention to every little detail including the theme song. It had to be a hit. The producers reached out to Tina Turner who in turn called up Bono and The Edge. The result was a U2 song in disguise.

It wasn’t the global hit everyone had hoped for, but it did well in the U.K. and Europe. It was also one of the biggest songs in Hungary that year.

18. Tomorrow Never Knows (1997)

Pierce Brosnan was back. But there was confusion about what to do with the theme. For the first time ever, the producers turned things into a sort of competition, putting out a tender for possible theme songs. Pulp, The Cardigans, Saint Etienne, and Swan Lee all had a shot. For a while, it looked like k.d. lang was going to get the gig. But then Sheryl Crow swooped in, pushing k.d.’s song to the end credits. Sheryl’s performance was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award in the best song categories but lost out both times to Celine Dion and My Heart Will Go On from Titanic.

Story continues below advertisement

19. The World is Not Enough (1999)

For the 19th official Bond film, tenders were once again put out. Pulp was approached again as was Aimee Man. But given the musical environment of the time, the producer had this thing about having more of an electronica feel with this theme. But at the same time, they knew they couldn’t deviate too much from the big orchestral arrangements because that was so Bond, you know? Tradition!

They hired composer David Arnold to sort things out. He wrote the theme, tested demos with the producer, and then started looking for someone to perform it. Calls went out to Bjork, Melanie C of The Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, and Robbie Williams. In the end, the job went to Shirley Manson and Garbage. Shirley was third because being Scottish, she grew up watching Sean Connery as Bond.

Story continues below advertisement

There was an ugly plagiarism charge from a couple of songwriters who believed The World is Not Enough sounded too much like the theme they wrote for The Thomas Crown Affair, but that was dismissed by a judge. In the end, Garbage proved to be a successful pick.

20. Die Another Day (2002)

You’ve probably noticed by now that there are some commonalities through most James Bond themes. They tend to be in a minor key; there’s usually a foreboding vibe; and there’s always an orchestral arrangement, which serves as a form of audio continuity through the series. Without those three things, the producers reasoned, the theme could be for any old action movie. That template became more pronounced through the 21st century.

Story continues below advertisement

With the 20th Bond film, the producers demanded a hit in America, so they went right to the top: Madonna. She believed that Bond needed to go techno-y. And it worked. Die Another Day was the highest-charting Bond theme since 1985’s A View to a Kill.

21. Casino Royale (2006)

It was time for a new Bond. With Daniel Craig stepping into the role, the producers needed to define Craig in every aspect, including the title sequence theme. This apparently called for a strong male singer so a studio executive called up Chris Cornell. He thought she was calling about placing a song somewhere deep on the soundtrack and was shocked that he was the first choice for the title theme.

Story continues below advertisement

Cornell loved the Connery movies and some of the Moore ones, but he’d lost interest during the Dalton and Brosnan years. But when he saw some of the rough cuts featuring Craig, he liked what he saw and signed on.

The song is a co-write with David Arnold, the composer of the film’s score. Chris’ parts were written in his apartment in Paris while listening to Tom Jones’ Thunderball over and over, just so he could come up with the right feel. He also spent a lot of time with Live and Let Die. It worked. The song was both a critical success and it was nominated for a Grammy. No one seemed to matter that the movie and the song had different titles.

22. Quantum of Solace (2008)

Through all 21 previous Bond films, the theme was sung by a single person. That was the plan for Quantum of Solace, too, but Amy Winehouse and Leona Lewis apparently didn’t have time to contribute anything. That’s when the job fell to Jack White who brought in Alicia Keys. Jack wrote the song, played all the instruments, and produced everything. The video was shot in Toronto during TIFF while Jack was promoting his guitar documentary, It Might Get Loud and Alicia Keys was in the city for her film, The Secret Life of Bees. And since there’s no elegant way to incorporate “quantum of solace” into the lyrics, no one bothered hence Another Way to Die.

Not a great charting single but it’s certainly a fine short film.

23. Skyfall (2012)

In 2012, Adele was one of the biggest-selling artists in the universe, so she was a natural pick for the theme for Bond film no. 23. The result is about a modern classic as you can get. Co-written by Paul Epworth, Adele’s theme ticks every Bond theme box — and then some. The secret? Epworth listened to all the themes over and over and using a little music theory determined that he need to use some variation of something called a minor ninth. That’s apparently the secret sauce, though construction and recording the song took 18 months.

24. Spectre (2015)

This one was messy. A lot of artists submitted tracks. That included Radiohead, who really thought they had a shot with a reworked song that began life as Man of War in the late 1990s that they now called SPECTRE. It’s a great song but since it wasn’t written specifically for the film, it was ineligible for any original song awards. Sorry, guys. When it was rumoured that they were writing a song just for the movie during the sessions for their Moon-Shaped Pool album. English bookies had to stop taking bets that they would get the gig. That didn’t work, either, because it was ruled “too melancholy.” (Radiohead later released Spectre online for free.)

Story continues below advertisement

Surprise! The gig when to Sam Smith, a flavour-of-the-moment English singer. And it was … fine. Writing’s on the Wall was a huge hit in the U.K. but a flop everywhere else. Then again, it did win both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award, so go figure.

25. No Time to Die (2021)

Remember the Billie Eilish theme for this one? Even though the movie just opened in the U.K. this past week (Sept. 28) and won’t appear elsewhere in the world until Oct. 8, No Time to Die is over and done as a record. It was released on Feb. 13, 2020, to coincide with the first proposed rescheduled release of the movie. That was so long ago that it was on the radio before COVID-19. It even won a Grammy for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

Addendum

While there have been 25 official James Bond movies, two films fall outside the canon controlled by Eon Productions.

Casino Royale (original, 1967)

David Niven’s one-and-only turn as Bond saw him come out of retirement and promoted to the head of MI6 to help smash SMERSH. It arrived two months before You Only Live Twice and was a surprising financial success. And did I mention it was a comedy? And that Burt Baracharch wrote a song called The Look of Love which won an Academy Award? Not a typical Bond song, though. Maybe this was satire, too.

Never Say Never Again (1983)

After sitting out most of the 1970s and early ’80s, Sean Connery wanted back in. Never Say Never is basically a remake of Thunderball with better special effects and was only made after a long legal fight with Eon Productions. And it did well, grossing US$160 million, a little less than Octopussy which had come out earlier in the year.

Story continues below advertisement

Was there a theme song? Yes. It was sung by Lani Hall, the wife of Herb Alpert (of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass and the “A” in A&M Records). The song, named after the movie, sank out of sight. Maybe the producers should have gone with their first choice, Bonnie Tyler."

Laura Osman,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017," 

The gravel strewn across the bike path was the first sign of trouble.

Ottawa resident Steven Grant was out for a ride on Sept. 19 when he noticed an LRT train stopped in the middle of the tracks. Gravel from the bed under the rails had been scattered all over the nearby path.

“The second and third cars of that train set were clearly off the rails,” Grant said in an interview Thursday. “You could see the side panel, the kind of cowling over the wheels, is totally, totally damaged.”

Later investigations revealed the train was already in a state of derailment when it left the station with 12 people on board, and travelled that way across a rail bridge over a major six-lane roadway before hitting a signal mast and switch heater.

 

The driver hit the emergency brake and stopped just on the other side of the bridge.

In any other city, Grant said he would have been surprised to come across a sight like that, but this is Ottawa’s Confederation Line, and the derailment was the second one in as many months.

The $2-billion line, a major infrastructure project in Canada’s capital city that had been more than a decade in the making, opened just two years ago. It’s been plagued by calamities big and small.

A sinkhole swallowed a major downtown thoroughfare during construction. Door jams delayed the line for hours. Wheels developed flat spots. The stations smelled of raw sewage for some time. Salt spray from Ottawa’s roads gummed up the electrical works. Showers of sparks would occasionally cascade past the windows because the arm that connects the train to the power lines kept losing contact. These are just a few of the things.

 

A growing chorus of transit riders, advocates and local politicians are demanding answers.

“My biggest fear is that there’s an accident where there is injury or loss of life. You cannot help but feel that today,” Ottawa Coun. Catherine McKenney said in an interview. “What else about this system do we not know that could render it unsafe?”

The federal Transportation Safety Board says Ottawa’s LRT system has derailed five times in the last two years. Three of those derailments happened off the main tracks, likely on their way to the maintenance yard.

McKenney has called for a judicial inquiry into how the city landed in this mess, and what else could be wrong with it.

“I believe that only if we’re seen to be serious about getting to the root cause of all of the issues on this system will we be able to, in good faith, go to the federal government and ask for more funding to continue to expand our lines,” McKenney said. “That’s what I hope that a judicial inquiry will help to do.”

Mayor Jim Watson opposes the idea of a judicial review, worrying it will slow progress on subsequent phases of the project.

 

Compared to the sprawling systems in other cities, Ottawa’s Confederation Line is pretty straightforward. Literally, it’s a 12.5-kilometre straight, twinned track with 13 stops that runs partially underground.

It serves as the spine of Ottawa’s entire transit system, having replaced the rapid-transit routes in and out of the city’s core. Without it, the entire system stops until replacement buses can be marshalled to take passengers down busy streets not intended for heavy transit use.

Construction is already underway on Phase 2, which would extend the line to the east and west.

The federal Liberals’ re-election campaign promised to accelerate major public transit projects, and newly elected Ottawa Liberal MP Jenna Sudds, who had served as a city councillor since 2018, promised that the party would make extending the troubled Confederation Line even further into the suburbs a top priority.

Meanwhile, there hasn’t been a single train running for weeks, and there won’t be until repairs are made and the system is deemed safe. There’s no telling how long that will take.

“At this point, we don’t know,” Watson said Friday. “We’re not going to open it until it’s fully safe to our standards, and we have it signed off on by our independent safety monitor.”

 

Back in 2019, shortly after the line first opened, the doors of the trains would get stuck, jamming up the system for long periods of time. The crowds would build up to the point that hordes of commuters opted to make the 3.5-kilometre trek downtown on foot instead.

1:38 NTSB says data shows Amtrak train was travelling under speed limit before derailment NTSB says data shows Amtrak train was travelling under speed limit before derailment

That’s when Matthew Roberts, a software developer who lives in Ottawa, created LRTdown.ca to track outages and delays. An automated Twitter account lets riders know how many days it’s been since the last delay. The single-page website says: “Is the LRT down? YES.”

“It seemed like there was constant problems happening, so I thought it would be funny,” Roberts said in an interview.

Little did he know the joke would still be relevant two years later. The website isn’t perfect, it simply scrapes OC Transpo’s service tweets, so it will occasionally miss an outage if the transit service fails to tweet it out.

 

The longest streak of actual service on record according to the program? Thirty-two days.

“That tells me there are problems,” Roberts said. “It’s just been one issue after the next, and honestly, I think it’s embarrassing.”

David Jeanes has been advocating for better rail options as a member of Transport Action Canada since 1976, and he said he’s never seen the kind of issues Ottawa is experiencing.

“Any of the problems that happened in Ottawa might happen occasionally somewhere else. But they don’t have a new problem every week,” he said.

One project isn’t enough to break Canada’s trust in light rail, Jeanes said, but other cities will be watching Ottawa’s situation carefully to see if they can avoid the same mishaps.

 

It’s too late to tear up the tracks, he said, so fixing it is now the only option.

“I still hope that Ottawa’s system will work out because we can’t do without it,” he said.

Though no one is quite sure what it will take to get the project back on the rails."

As of Oct. 3, more than 56,438,047 doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across Canada.

So far, 29,332,094 Canadians have received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine, while 27,105,953 Canadians are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, having received both required doses.

On June 19, Canada hit the vaccination milestone of inoculating at least 75 per cent of its eligible population with at least one dose and 20 per cent with both. As of Sept. 30, those numbers have risen to 88 per cent with one dose and 81.1 per cent with two.

Hospitalizations, which also saw a significant drop earlier this summer, are now also starting to climb again.

As of Sept. 29, the latest seven-day average of those seeking treatment in hospital for COVID-19 has risen to 2,342 patients per day, a roughly 500 per cent jump from just one month ago. About 750 people are being treated in intensive care units.

The average number of deaths per day now sits around 40, marking a continued upward climb from the significant drop seen earlier this summer.

Federal modelling done in April and May suggested that if 75 per cent of eligible Canadians — those 12 years old and above — had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 20 per cent had two, provinces could safely begin easing restrictions on public movement without overwhelming hospitals again.

But Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the variants used to develop those models didn’t include Delta, which is the most infectious one tracked in Canada to date, believed to cause more severe illness, and is expected to become the dominant variant circling.

She says cautious, staged reopenings, which leave lots of room to monitor an increase in case counts and detect surges of variants like Delta, will be critical.

Other variants of concern, like the Alpha variant that was first identified in the United Kingdom, are also continuing to spread across the country.

 

British Columbia

What you need to know As of Jan. 14, Global News is counting both lab-confirmed and epidemiologically-linked cases for British Columbia, which includes both kinds of cases in their official count. Data prior to Jan. 14 has been corrected.

B.C. reported 749 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest update on Sept 30. The new infections bring the province’s total to 186,994.

Nine new deaths means the province’s death toll stands at 1,962. At least 177,729 cases have recovered.

The Vancouver School District’s extension of a mask mandate that will include kindergarten to Grade 3 students starting Monday has prompted calls for more districts in British Columbia to follow suit in the absence of a provincewide public health order.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has resisted calls by parents and teachers to make the face coverings mandatory for all students, saying ventilation and limitations to intermingling between classes in different grades are also important factors in schools.

Henry said Tuesday that more children between the ages of five and 11 are being diagnosed with COVID-19 in the eastern Fraser Health region because they are not eligible for vaccines and due to the lower vaccination rates in at least four communities there.

Kyenta Martins, who speaks for parent-led group Safe Schools Coalition BC, said a rise in cases should prompt a provincewide mask mandate for all children if the goal is to keep students learning in schools.

Henry has dismissed rapid testing as unreliable, including for residents of long-term care facilities earlier in the pandemic, and said Tuesday that regional health authorities would be posting potential exposures of COVID-19 at schools on their websites so parents have an authoritative source of information.

The B.C. Teachers Federation pushed for a mask mandate for months before Henry implemented it last March, and the union’s president, Teri Mooring, said Wednesday there’s no acceptable rationale for not extending it now to younger grades.

 

Alberta

What you need to know Alberta Health reported on Oct. 1 that 1,630 new COVID-19 cases had been identified in the last 24 hours, along with 14 more coronavirus-related deaths.

Since the pandemic began, the province has seen a total of 299,802 infections and 2,731 deaths, while 276,856 people have recovered.

Alberta’s Opposition is calling on Premier Jason Kenney to make sure every member of his United Conservative Party caucus is vaccinated against COVID-19.

Thomas Dang, the NDP’s deputy house leader, says anyone who is not vaccinated should be removed from caucus, and with Alberta hospitals overcrowded with infected patients, it’s imperative that political leaders set the right example and get their shots.

“You cannot be a government MLA and refuse to be vaccinated,” Dang said Friday.

“That selfish choice leads to directly preventable deaths and human suffering. I’m calling on Jason Kenney to require that every single one of his MLAs be vaccinated for COVID-19 or be immediately ejected from the government caucus.”

Dang says all 24 NDP legislature members and 30 staff have received both vaccine doses.

On Thursday, Global News reached out to the premier’s office to ask how many members of the UCP caucus are vaccinated. As of Friday afternoon, there had been no response.

Kenney said Thursday that his government has been working with the Opposition on a plan to try to bring in a proof-of-vaccination policy, however, Dang and NDP MLA Christina Gray said nobody from the government had approached their party about such a plan.

Kenney said trying to implement such a plan could be difficult because of MLAs’ constitutional right to not be barred from entering the legislature.

 

Saskatchewan

What you need to know Saskatchewan announced 602 new infections in the latest update on Sept. 30. The province has now seen a total of 67,339 cases of the virus.

The province’s death toll stands at 695 after 10 new deaths were reported, while 61,975 people have recovered from the virus.

Saskatchewan recorded its highest daily case count of COVID-19 and its highest number of people needing intensive care, as a member of the government caucus resigned for ”misrepresenting her vaccination status.“

Premier Scott Moe said he accepted Thursday the resignation of Nadine Wilson, who has represented the constituency of Saskatchewan Rivers since 2007. She will remain as an MLA but will be considered an Independent in the legislature.

Moe said the remaining 47 members of the Saskatchewan Party caucus are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

At a news conference in Saskatoon, Moe said information about Wilson came to light as the province moved toward its proof-of-vaccination policy for government staff, which starts Friday.

Wilson said in an email Thursday that she can “no longer support the direction of the Saskatchewan Party government or follow the government with true conviction regarding the current health situation.”

Of all the provinces, Saskatchewan has the highest case rate in the last seven days and the highest death rate. Data compiled by Health Canada also shows Saskatchewan residents are four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than people in any other province except Alberta.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to provide any supports necessary to help Saskatchewan with its growing COVID-19 crisis.

 

Manitoba

What you need to know As of Aug. 14, Global News is counting both lab-confirmed and presumptive cases for Manitoba, which no longer provides a breakdown of its cases. Data prior to Aug. 14 has been corrected.

Manitoba reported 114 new COVID-19 cases and no new deaths in the latest update on Sept. 29.

The province has seen a total of 60,443 infections, an unknown number of which are considered probable cases.

The province’s death toll stands at 1,211 while at least 58,564 people have recovered overall.

Health officials say Manitoba has clearly entered the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases are rising, especially in regions where vaccination rates are low.

Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba’s chief public health officer, says the southern health region makes up 15 per cent of the province’s population but almost half of daily COVID-19 cases.

Roussin says he’s concerned because vaccination and COVID-19 testing rates in the region are low.

He says too often people from the region are getting their first COVID-19 test when they are hospitalized.

Manitoba had held off the fourth wave for months, largely by maintaining public health orders, including a mask mandate, and requiring proof of vaccination to eat in restaurants and attend sporting events.

 

Ontario

What you need to know Ontario reported 495 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest update on Sept. 29, with eight new deaths.

The province has seen a total of 585,502 confirmed cases and 9,723 deaths from the virus. However, 570,790 individuals have recovered.

An increase in cases of a rare heart condition among young adults who received the COVID-19 Moderna vaccines has prompted Ontario to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech shots for those aged 18 to 24.

Ministry of Health officials made the recommendation on Wednesday, noting that cases of myocarditis and pericarditis had been particularly observed among males in that age group.

The province’s top doctor Dr. Kieran Moore said the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks, but noted he made the recommendation out of an “abundance of caution” and to be transparent with the public.

He stressed that risk remains “very rare” and symptoms resolve quickly, and noted that his own children who are in the age group affected by the recommendation received Moderna shots with no issues.

Between June and August, the province said the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for males aged 18 to 24 following a second dose of Moderna was one in 5,000. For those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, the rate was one in 28,000. That data was based on 96,000 second doses of vaccines administered to males in that age group.

 

Quebec

What you need to know Quebec reported 655 new cases of COVID-19 in its latest update on Sept. 30 and two new virus-related deaths.

The province has seen a total of 410,180 cases and 11,371 deaths to date, although more than 392,000 recoveries have been reported.

Quebec health authorities are lifting capacity restrictions on venues with assigned seating starting Oct. 8 but say it’s too soon to permit larger indoor private gatherings.

Health Minister Christian Dube made the announcement today, saying anyone attending events at those venues will need to show proof of vaccination and wear masks.

The new rules apply to cinemas, theatres, conferences and graduation ceremonies, and they will also permit Montreal’s Bell Centre to be at full capacity for the Canadiens’ first NHL home game in October.

Dube says Quebec has done well during the month of September, but it remains too early to declare victory in the fight against COVID-19 or to lift the 10-person indoor gathering limit inside private homes.

The Public Security Department says police forces across the province have issued 34 tickets related to the province’s vaccine passport system.

 

New Brunswick

What you need to know New Brunswick reported 99 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest update on Sept. 30, with two new deaths.

There have been 4,187 cases in total, at least 3,437 of whom have since recovered. The province’s death toll stands at 59 people.

Of the new cases, officials say 72 people are not fully vaccinated. A total of 40 people are in hospital with the disease, including 16 in intensive care.

Among the new cases Thursday, there are 36 in the Moncton region, 29 in the Edmundston area, 24 in the Fredericton area, three in each of the Campbellton and Miramichi regions and two each in the Saint John and Bathurst areas.

Officials say positive cases have been confirmed in schools in the Moncton, Saint John, Fredericton and Edmundston regions. In Moncton, one positive case was confirmed at four schools while, a new positive case was also identified at three other schools that had previous cases.

Under New Brunswick’s COVID-19 health guidelines schools with cases close for online learning for a least one day to allow for contact tracing and risk assessments.

Meanwhile, officials also updated the province’s vaccination rate saying 80 per cent of people 12 and older are now fully vaccinated, while 88.9 per cent have received their first dose of a vaccine.

 

Nova Scotia

What you need to know Nova Scotia reported 41 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest update on Sept. 29.

The total number of cases in the province is 6,638, with 97 deaths, while 6,317 cases have recovered.

Nova Scotia will move into the final phase of its reopening plan on Monday with what officials say is a cautious approach involving vaccine mandates for public sector employees such as health workers and teachers.

Vaccination against COVID-19 will be required by the end of November for a broad range of public employees, chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang said Wednesday, including hospital and long-term care workers, physicians, paramedics, teachers and other educational staff.

Strang said workers will need to provide proof of vaccination by Nov. 30 or face being put on unpaid administrative leave. Unvaccinated employees are required to participate in a vaccine education program, Strang said, adding that all new hires in the targeted sectors must be vaccinated.

Also beginning Oct. 15, a third or booster dose of an mRNA vaccine will be offered to people who require it for work-related travel and those who are immunocompromised.

Most restrictions will be lifted Monday, Premier Tim Houston said, including physical distancing and gathering limits for events hosted by a recognized business or organization. But mask-wearing will still be mandatory in indoor public spaces and informal gatherings will still be limited to 25 people indoors and 50 outdoors, he added.

Also starting Monday, people over the age of 12 will be required to show proof of vaccination to access services and businesses the government deems non-essential, such restaurants, movie theatres and gyms.

 

Prince Edward Island

What you need to know P.E.I. reported three new COVID-19 cases in the latest update on Sept. 30.

The total number of cases in the province is 299, and 290 cases have recovered. No deaths have been reported.

Prince Edward Island is increasing COVID-19 testing at its borders beginning Thursday because of the growing presence of the Delta novel coronavirus variant in Atlantic Canada.

Chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison said Tuesday everyone entering the province, including Island residents returning home, will be tested regardless of their vaccination status.

Morrison is also recommending that travellers who are 12 and older be tested again between the fourth and eighth day after they enter the province.

She says school-aged children under 12 who return to P.E.I. from travelling will be required to test negative for COVID-19 before they can go back to school.

 

Newfoundland and Labrador

What you need to know Newfoundland and Labrador reported 16 new cases in the latest update on Sept. 29.

The province has seen 1,747 confirmed cases and eight deaths, while 1,568 cases have recovered.

Newfoundland and Labrador is reintroducing travel restrictions for children under 12, requiring them to stay home from school, daycares and sporting events and away from vulnerable populations for at least a week after they arrive back in the province.

The province’s acting chief medical officer of health said today that if children aged five to 11 get a negative COVID-19 test after Day 7, they can return to school, but they must continue to avoid after-school programs as well as long-term care homes.

Dr. Rosann Seviour says children younger than five don’t have to get tested as long as their parents are tested on Day 7 or later, but they must abide by all of the restrictions and stay home as much as possible for the two weeks after they arrive.

Dr. Proton Rahman, Memorial University’s associate dean of clinical research, says about 80 per cent of the province’s current cases are linked to the Delta variant, and more young children have been infected in the province’s latest outbreaks than in past outbreaks.

Just over 80 per cent of eligible Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which was government’s original vaccination rate goal, but Health Minister John Haggie says the Delta variant demands a vaccination rate closer to 90 per cent.

 

Yukon

What you need to know Yukon added four new cases of COVID-19 over two days in its latest update on Sept. 29.

There have been 754 cases to date, 710 of whom have recovered. The territory has seen nine deaths from COVID-19.

The Government of Yukon says students in several elementary classes at two schools in the communities of Watson Lake and Carcross have been asked to self-isolate as a result of positive COVID-19 tests, though the schools remain open.

The government says letters advising self-isolation have been sent home for students in Grades 1, 4 and 5 at Johnson Elementary School in Watson Lake near the B.C. boundary.

The territory says similar letters have also been sent for students in Kindergarten and the Grade 1, 2 and 3 split class at Ghuch Tia Community School in Carcross.

It says Yukon’s top doctor has provided specific directions to all staff and students after risk assessments were conducted by Yukon Communicable Disease Control, and the directions differ for older students and staff based on vaccination status.

Grade 10 students at Watson Lake Senior Secondary have been advised to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19, but they are not required to self-isolate, and that school remains open as well.

 

Northwest Territories

What you need to know The Northwest Territories added 45 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest update on Sept. 29.

The territory has seen a total of 1,059 local cases, six of whom have died. A total of 770 cases have recovered.

The Northwest Territories have introduced stricter public health measures and extending current orders as the territory continues to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19.

Starting last Saturday, public gatherings in the capital of Yellowknife and surrounding areas were limited to 10 people indoors, down from 25.

All schools and non-essential businesses will remain closed until at least Oct. 4.

Chief public health officer, Dr. Kami Kandola, says health care in the N.W.T. is stretched and the measures are meant to act as a circuit-breaker.

 

Nunavut

What you need to know Nunavut reported one new case of COVID-19 in its latest update on Sept. 29.

There have been 664 cases to date, 658 of which have recovered, and the territory has seen four deaths from the virus.

Health restrictions were lifted in the community of Arviat last week after health officials confirmed no community spread of COVID-19.

Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s chief public health officer, said all samples collected during the investigation came back negative. The investigation was launched after a presumptive positive case was detected, which also later came back negative.

Effective immediately, the territory has lifted its recommendation not to travel in and out of Arviat, and individuals who aren’t fully vaccinated won’t have to isolate after leaving the community. Limits on gatherings have also been increased, and activities like team sports and indoor dining can resume.

All of Nunavut is once again under a mask mandate, however. The territory lifted the mandate in July, but Patterson reinstated it earlier this month in response to rising cases in southern Canada.

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

"Carolyn Jarvis, Andrew Russell, Emanuela Campanella",Global News,11/28/2017,"Walk inside Moderna and the feeling of urgency is palpable. It makes sense. The world has been struggling under a pandemic for almost two years, and the biotech firm is fighting to stay ahead of COVID-19, which has killed more than 4.5 million people worldwide. Moderna’s manufacturing site is located 40 minutes outside of Boston, a former Polaroid plant, where vaccine production lines operate around the clock, executives function on minimal sleep, and employees are fuelled by a cocktail of adrenaline and purpose. For two days in September, Global News became the only Canadian news outlet ever to be invited inside Moderna’s operations — for a first-hand look at its manufacturing hub and its headquarters. WATCH: Inside Moderna and its fight to stay ahead of the virus 2:06 Inside Moderna and its fight to stay ahead of the virus Inside Moderna and its fight to stay ahead of the virus Seventy-five per cent of Moderna’s U.S. supply comes from its Norwood technology centre, a cluster of three buildings which are referred to as a “campus” with “neighbourhoods.” The site is growing by the day in an attempt to keep up with global demand. “To give you a feel for how fast we scaled, we’re right now, in manufacturing, around a thousand employees. We have doubled in about five months,” Scott Nickerson, the company’s senior vice-president of U.S. manufacturing, told Global’s current affairs show, The New Reality. ”We’re trying to hire about 500 more as we speak.” Advertisement

How mRNA-1273 is made The centrepiece of the Norwood plant is the production line — showcased through walls of glass, highlighting the intricacy of the manufacturing process. Teams work to produce everything from personalized cancer vaccines to its COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273. “In the case of the coronavirus, we got the sequence from China in early January and within a number of days, down to about a week, we were able to come back with a number of different development candidates that we could try out in our labs before we went into (production),” said Nickerson. The first step in making a vaccine begins at a computer, when a DNA sequence is entered into Moderna’s proprietary software, called the Drug Design Studio. The DNA is then transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which gives the body instructions on how to fight a pathogen. A giant steel box, which looks like an oversized fridge, completes one of the most crucial steps: covering the mRNA in a fatty envelope, called a lipid nano-particle, which allows it to enter human cells. The finished product is then filtered, frozen and shipped out of state to be bottled. Throughout the process, preventing contamination is paramount. Rooms are routinely monitored for microbes and different sections of the manufacturing floor are meticulously colour-coded and taped off. Sensors, typically used by the NFL to track athletes, are mounted on the ceiling to follow employees through a receiver on their ID badge. This ensures operators working in one area don’t cross over into another. “We have an alarm that will go off if the operator goes outside of the space they’re supposed to (work) in,” Nickerson said. “It’s important.”

Vaccines vs. variants As countries around the globe struggle with resurging COVID-19 cases fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant, Moderna is tacking its sails by tailoring boosters shots to the virus’s mutations. The company has six different boosters in its pipeline, including ones targeting the Delta variant and the Beta variant, multivalent boosters which combine formulations — even a COVID-19 booster combined with a flu shot. “We’ve probably tested over 100 different variants and their mutation combinations over the last six months alone,” said Moderna’s president, Stephen Hoge. “The moment there’s the first posting of a new sequence to the international databases, we download that … we start testing against it.” Advertisement 2:17 Delayed second COVID-19 vaccine doses giving lasting protection Delayed second COVID-19 vaccine doses giving lasting protection For now, Moderna believes its original formulation holds up against the dominant variants in circulation. The question is: for how long? “Our clinical trials, which are the longest exposures to the vaccine and the virus that we have, are starting to suggest to us that it’s time to get concerned and get ready,” Hoge said. Moderna has been studying the response to its vaccine since the summer of 2020, when it enrolled 30,000 people in Phase 3 of its clinical trials. Data from that trial indicates antibody levels start to wane about six months after the second shot. While it is expected antibodies will decrease over time, Hoge says troubling signals came this summer, at the height of the Delta variant outbreak in the U.S., when they started to see a significant spike in breakthrough cases of symptomatic COVID-19, among fully vaccinated clinical trial participants. 1:54 U.S. FDA, CDC support Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for people high-risk or aged 65+ U.S. FDA, CDC support Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for people high-risk or aged 65+ – Sep 23, 2021 It’s not clear if the driving force behind those breakthrough cases is the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant or a decrease in the effectiveness of the original two-dose vaccine. “We don’t know,” said Hoge. “What we can say is the combination of Delta and about nine to 12 months of time since your vaccine is leading to substantially higher breakthrough rates in our clinical trial.” Moderna is erring on the side of caution, asking regulators in the U.S. to green-light a half-dose (50 micrograms) of its original vaccine for use six months after the second shot. Hoge says its data shows the booster brings antibody levels even higher than after the initial shots across all age groups. “What we’re doing as a manufacturer is making sure that the options are there,” he said. “It will ultimately fall to groups like NACI and Health Canada to decide whether to deploy (boosters) in populations.” Moderna has not yet submitted an application for its booster to Health Canada, but it is expected imminently. In September, Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) updated its guidance to give additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines to people who are immunocompromised or living in congregate care settings, like long-term care homes. Many Canadian scientists studying COVID-19 vaccines push back against the notion of boosters at this point, saying the protection from two doses is still robust — especially against the target objective of preventing severe outcomes, like hospitalization and death."
Saba Aziz,Global News,11/28/2017," 

Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is now recommending COVID-19 booster shots for residents of long-term care homes and seniors living in other congregate settings.

According to the updated recommendation from NACI on Tuesday, seniors who have already received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine should be offered a third shot at least six months after their last dose.

However, a booster dose of the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccine should only be considered when an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine — from Pfizer and Moderna — is contraindicated or inaccessible, NACI said.

In making the recommendation, the agency reviewed data on vaccine effectiveness and waning antibody responses after complete vaccination.

 

“NACI has determined that there is an immediate need to provide a recommendation for a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in residents of long-term care and seniors living in other congregate settings as they are at increased risk of infection and severe disease and due to signs that protection might not persist as long in these individuals as in other populations in Canada,” it said on its website.

Besides long-term care homes, other congregate settings include retirement homes, assisted-living facilities and chronic care hospitals.

Earlier this month, NACI backed a third shot for some immunocompromised individuals.

Based on the recommendations released on Sept. 10, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, advised “an additional dose, or third dose of COVID-19 vaccine, for moderately or severely immunocompromised people who are more likely to have had a less than adequate immune response to the initial one or two dose COVID-19 vaccine series.”

 

Dr. Tam said the advice applies to people 12 and up whose immune systems are compromised for a variety of reasons, like being treated for a tumour or having an untreated HIV infection that has advanced.

Canadian studies have suggested that even though people in long-term care had a good antibody response to two doses of vaccine, the majority of residents did not have a detectable level of antibodies against the Delta variant six months later.

Before NACI’s announcement, several provinces had already approved COVID-19 booster shots for people in long-term care homes, including Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and most recently, Quebec.

On Tuesday, British Columbia also said it would start offering third doses to residents in long-term care and assisted living from next week.

“The intent of a booster dose is to restore protection that may have waned over time in individuals who responded adequately to a primary vaccine series,” NACI said, adding that the strategy would help prevent outbreaks among the vulnerable population.

 

Long-term care has borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, where aging residents and congregate living proved to be a tragic combination.

About 69 per cent of Canada’s total pandemic-related deaths happened in long-term care homes as of February 2021, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

Natural immunity will not protect you against COVID-19 as well as an mRNA vaccine, according to both experts and the research.

Multiple anti-vaccine groups touted natural immunity as a viable alternative to getting vaccinated, but experts say the natural immunity is unreliable — especially when there’s a safe and effective vaccine out there.

Even if you’ve already had COVID, you should still get vaccinated, doctors say.

“The idea of natural immunity, people are kind of taking that and running with it, thinking, ‘I don’t need to get vaccinated.’ That’s not true, either,” said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti.

“Natural immunity does certainly protect you, but we don’t know to what extent.”

 

Vaccines, on the other hand, offer consistent protection against COVID-19 — and unlike natural immunity, you don’t have to get sick to gain the protective benefits of a vaccine.

What is natural immunity?

When you get sick and, eventually, beat a virus, your body learns about the virus that made you sick — so you can ideally avoid being infected again in the future.

“Our immune systems have evolved over millions and millions of years to provide us with lasting immunity from infections that we encounter early in life,” said Dr. Matthew Miller, assistant dean at McMaster University’s department of biochemistry and biomedical sciences.

2:07 Some parents push for COVID-19 vaccine approval for children Some parents push for COVID-19 vaccine approval for children

When Canadians caught COVID-19, the same thing happened — to a point.

 

Provided they survive the illness, patients generally emerge with some protection against COVID-19. That’s why Chakrabarti said there is indeed a “nugget of truth” to the idea that natural immunity can help keep people a bit safer from the virus.

But the level of protection Canadians can get from catching COVID is inconsistent.

“There’s a huge amount of variability in the strength of immunity that’s conferred by natural infection,” said Miller.

“We know, for example, that people who have very mild or asymptomatic cases have much lower levels of immunity than people who have had more symptomatic or severe infections.”

By contrast, the mRNA vaccines offer a high level of protection against severe outcomes from COVID-19 — and they do it consistently.

“The people who are arguing for natural immunity (over) vaccine-elicited immunity often do so with the assumption that natural immunity is superior,” Miller said.

“And in the context of COVID-19, and especially in comparison to our COVID mRNA vaccines, there’s just not strong evidence that that’s the case.”

In fact, there’s some research that suggests that isn’t the case.

 

One study published on June 30 in Science Translational Medicine found people who were fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine had antibodies that were more broadly protective against variants than the ones produced by COVID-19 patients.

2:56 Health Matters: Mothers turning to breast milk to protect children too young for COVID-19 vaccines Health Matters: Mothers turning to breast milk to protect children too young for COVID-19 vaccines – May 27, 2021

The CDC published similar findings. Among Kentucky residents who caught COVID during 2020, the ones that were unvaccinated were more than two times more likely to be re-infected compared to the residents who were fully vaccinated.

On top of that, COVID-19 infection can weaken your immune response, according to a June study published by the University of Oxford, which could put you at higher risk of catching a variant of COVID-19.

Compared with fully vaccinated people, unvaccinated individuals are also seven times more likely to catch COVID-19, 25 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 60 times more likely to be in the ICU due to the disease, according to a new report from the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table.

 

However, if you still get your jab after having recovered from COVID, Miller said something interesting can happen: an even higher level of immunity reportedly takes root.

“There’s really excellent evidence now that people who have had a prior infection and are then vaccinated are the best protected of all,” said Miller.

In fact, they may be able to achieve that level of protection with just one jab, studies published in the New York Times suggested. Chakrabarti agreed.

“People who have gotten infected, the evidence actually shows, if you get a single dose of the vaccine after that, that’s actually very robust immunity,” he said.

The risks of pursuing natural immunity

Natural immunity is also a dangerous thing to pursue, doctors warned.

In Alberta, a number of residents ended up in the ICU after reportedly having a COVID party in an intentional bid to contract COVID-19 and gain antibodies against the virus.

 

“By necessity, to get to immunity, you first have to go through the process of infection,” Miller said.

“And in the context of COVID-19, obviously, those infections can be very severe and sometimes fatal.”

Chakrabarti agreed with Miller.

“To intentionally expose yourself if you haven’t been, that’s not advisable, given that there’s a risk of you getting ill, there’s a risk of other people getting ill,” he said.

Intentionally exposing yourself to COVID-19 at a party, Chakrabarti added, “can result in significant spill over into the community.”

“When you’re in…a region that has a very, very stretched hospital capacity, and now you have one of many types of events where multiple people get sick and potentially hospitalized, it just adds to the strain,” he said.

Some people might not even know that they have an underlying condition, too, which Miller said can put them at serious risk if they catch COVID-19.

 

“They assume they’re low risk, but then get infected and some underlying condition that they weren’t aware of before then surfaces and they wind up on life support or in the worst case scenario, dead,” he said.

“It’s rolling the dice in a way that’s really irresponsible at an individual level and then even more irresponsible at the community level.”

A nuanced approach

And while Chakrabarti says we should make sure we aren’t “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” when it comes to the potential benefits of natural immunity, it’s also important to keep those benefits in perspective.

“This should not be a topic that is controversial just because there are individuals who are…distorting the message,” he said.

“We should be able to talk about these very important infectious disease issues for what they are: it’s a scientific concept that has implications.”

 

Miller agreed that there is “truth” to the fact that “natural immunity is immunity and we can be protected by it.”

“But it’s not a wise strategy to achieve immunity by choice.”"
Leslie Young,Global News,11/28/2017,"The Regeneron antibody cocktail, a combination of drugs used to treat COVID-19, is flying off the shelves in the United States.

The U.S. has purchased nearly three million doses at a cost of around US$2,100 each — much higher than a typical dose of COVID-19 vaccine — and is making the treatment available to patients for free, said the manufacturer.

And the World Health Organization endorsed on Friday the medication for some patients at high risk of hospitalization.

But in Canada, this and other drugs, known as monoclonal antibody treatments, are hardly being used — even though doctors say they would be a useful addition to their COVID-fighting arsenal.

“This new antibody cocktail is the one that is probably the most promising for people with mild COVID-19 and also seems to be promising for people who are hospitalized with COVID-19, who are naïve to the virus: so they haven’t been vaccinated or they haven’t been infected before,” said Dr. Amol Verma, a physician and scientist at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto.

These drugs are a direct shot of antibodies targeting the virus that causes COVID-19, he said, designed to help people who have already been infected better fight it off, and lessening the chance that they may have to be hospitalized.

'It did wonders'

Some patients say the treatments made a huge difference in their lives.

Joyce Wachsmuth, of Eau Claire, Wis., and her husband were infected with COVID-19 in January. A breast cancer survivor, she had never felt so much pain.

Story continues below advertisement

When doctors at the local Mayo Clinic told the 67-year-old that she and her 70-year-old husband were prime candidates for what was then an experimental drug treatment with monoclonal antibodies, she jumped at the opportunity, she told the Associated Press in August.

Wachsmuth said she felt relief just two hours after the one-hour drip treatment.

“It did wonders. It kept us off the hospital and off the ventilators,” said Wachsmuth, who has since been vaccinated.

“From everything that we know so far, and we have several studies on this, it’s remarkably effective,” said Dr. Andrew Morris, an infectious diseases physician at Sinai Health and University Health Network and professor at the University of Toronto.

But although he thinks it’s useful, Morris said, “In Canada, we just don’t have enough of it.”

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canada has received 6,000 doses of the antibody cocktail, with another 3,000 doses due to come in October — far less than the U.S.’s order of 3 million doses.

Almost every province Global News contacted reported limited supply, with some like New Brunswick saying the treatment wasn’t available at all.

Treatment issues

There are a few reasons why these treatments aren’t broadly used in Canada, said Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada, at a press conference Friday.

“It’s not really fundamentally about cost. There’s access, but also feasibility of delivery,” she said. “For example, one of the antibody combinations used to have to be given intravenously. And there’s new data to show that you can actually give it under the skin now, and that might then increase the viability of the use of these medications in the frontline setting.”

The logistics of actually giving the medication to people are definitely a barrier, said Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre.

“These antibodies, because they require an intravenous infusion, necessarily required an infusion centre,” he said. “And infusion centres are usually done in a hospital setting where you bring people in and you have dedicated health-care personnel who put an intravenous into that person and they give them the medications and they make sure they don’t have any reactions.”

In the middle of a pandemic, there were issues finding personnel to do this, he said, and with making sure that the antibody patients — who have active COVID-19 — are kept away from other people in the hospital.

“Now you’re bringing these people who are infected into a hospital setting, which is obviously not a good thing because you don’t want them exposing other people with a virus,” he said.

In the U.S., some states have set up dedicated antibody treatment centres for COVID-19 patients.

Vinh is hoping to do something similar in Canada, in a dedicated area of the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, with negative pressure rooms and specially trained staff to ensure that infections don’t spread.

Like Tam, he thinks that new ways of delivering the drug subcutaneously will help solve logistical problems too.

Canada should “absolutely” use monoclonal antibody treatments more, Morris said.

“I think it is problematic that we haven’t been using the therapies yet or if we have, it’s been minimal. I see it as a very, very important part of our strategy of keeping people out of hospital and out of ICUs.”

While Vinh said vaccination is still the most important strategy for fighting the pandemic, antibody treatments have their place.

“These monoclonal antibodies are a welcome addition. They are not a silver bullet,” he said. But for people who get vaccinated but still get infected with COVID-19 and are at risk of complications, they are another tool, he added.

“We can’t just sit idly by and let them let them get infected and deteriorate. If they’ve done their part to get the vaccine, we need to do our part to make sure that we still protect them as much as we can.”

At least five civilians were killed in a bomb blast outside a Kabul mosque Sunday, a Taliban official said. It was the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since U.S. forces left at the end of August.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on Islamic State extremists who have stepped up attacks on the Taliban in recent weeks, particularly in an IS stronghold in eastern Afghanistan.

An apparent roadside bomb went off at the gate of the sprawling Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul at a time when a memorial service was being held for the mother of chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Five people were killed, said Qari Saeed Khosti, the spokesman of the Interior Ministry.

 

The explosion underscored the growing challenges the Taliban face just weeks after they took control of Afghanistan in a blitz campaign, culminating in their takeover of Kabul on Aug. 15.

During their 20-year insurgency, the Taliban themselves had frequently carried out bombing and shooting attacks, but are now faced with trying to contain rival militants using the same methods. The growing security challenges come at a time of an economic meltdown, as the Taliban struggle to run the country without the massive foreign aid given to U.S.-backed government they toppled.

Three suspects were arrested in Sunday’s explosion in Kabul, said Bilal Karimi, a Taliban spokesman. He said Taliban fighters were not harmed.

Mohammad Israil, a Kabul resident, said he heard “a loud sound” and saw people running away.

An Italian-funded emergency hospital in Kabul tweeted it had received four people wounded in the blast.

 

The area around the mosque was cordoned off by the Taliban, who maintained a heavy security presence. Later in the afternoon the site was cleaned. The only signs of the blast was slight damage to the ornamental arch by the entrance gate.

IS militants have stepped up attacks against the Taliban since their mid-August takeover, signaling a widening conflict between them.

IS maintains a strong presence in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where it has claimed responsibility for several killings in the provincial capital of Jalalabad.

In late August, an IS suicide bomber targeted American evacuation efforts at Kabul’s international airport. The blast killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members and was one of the deadliest attacks in the country in years.

Attacks in Kabul have so far been rare, but in recent weeks IS has shown signs it is expanding its footprint beyond the east and closer toward the capital.

The new criteria mean that nearly 2 million people will lose their vaccination passport in the coming days.

Israel is the first country to make a booster shot a requirement for its digital vaccination passport. The move is widely seen as a step to encourage booster vaccination among those who have yet to receive a third dose.

Under the new guidelines, people must have received a booster shot to be eligible for a green pass. Those who have received two vaccine doses, and those who have recovered from coronavirus, will be issued passes valid for six months after the date of their vaccination or recovery.

Israel raced out of the gate early this year to vaccinate most of its adult population after striking a deal with Pfizer to trade medical data in exchange for a steady supply of doses.

This summer Israel launched an aggressive booster campaign to shore up waning vaccine efficacy in its population. Over 60% of Israel’s population has received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and nearly 3.5 million of Israel’s 9.3 million citizens have received a booster dose of the vaccine. But at least 2 million more have received just two doses, and many will lose the privileges bestowed by the green pass.

Recent months have seen a surge in new cases of coronavirus in Israel. As of Sunday, over 70% of the 588 serious coronavirus cases in Israeli hospitals were unvaccinated individuals, according to Health Ministry data.

The research, which is being overseen by professors Andrés Finzi and Daniel Kaufmann from the Université de Montréal, could help answer key questions scientists around the world are grappling with: who needs a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine?

Finzi explained. “And is it possible that the interval between the doses may affect how good (the response) is?” In the face of surging caseloads, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, some health agencies have moved quickly to offer third doses to the elderly or immunocompromised, even as most countries have seen pandemics “among the unvaccinated.” However, the debate among public health experts over whether a booster dose is needed for healthy adults — and when they should be given — is divisive.

The Israeli test case 0:44 Israel approves 3rd booster shot of COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 60+ Israel approves 3rd booster shot of COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 60+ – Jul 29, 2021 Israel became one of the first, real-world test cases for COVID-19 vaccinations by locking in a supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with a unique deal: vaccines for data, according to a publicly released contract. Now the country has found itself at the centre of a raging global debate around the need for boosters. Over the summer, the country saw a surge in cases, fuelled by the Delta variant, which included thousands who were fully vaccinated. Israeli lawmakers responded by authorizing third doses for those 60 and over in late July before extending that to everyone 12 and older by the end of August. They are now even considering fourth doses, according to statements from Israeli health officials. Jonathan Halevy, president of Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center, said that since the booster campaign began, the country has seen a decline in hospitalizations. “We’ve seen the effect of the booster and the excellent protection it gives against severe disease,” Halevy said. View image in full screen Other countries, like the U.K., France, Germany, and Denmark, have taken more targeted approaches by offering third doses to vulnerable citizens like the immunocompromised and the elderly. In the U.S., President Joe Biden’s administration had planned to offer another round of shots to all fully vaccinated Americans, but the Centers for Disease Control ultimately rejected boosters for the general public, authorizing additional Pfizer-BioNTech doses only for people over 65, as well as those who are deemed high-risk, such as health care workers and teachers. Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has only approved additional shots for immunocompromised people and people living in long-term care homes. READ MORE: COVID-19 booster shots could rake in billions for some vaccine makers At the B.C Centre for Disease Control, Dr. Danuta Skowronski, the epidemiological lead, is among a group of scientists who are skeptical about the need for boosters. “Like a detective, we have to be very careful not to be fooled by what we may sense at first glance,” she said. Advertisement Skowronski has been tracking vaccine effectiveness in B.C. in real-time using a method her team first created for influenza in 2004 and is now used in 25 countries. Her data showed both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are offering “terrific” protection against the virus. Dr. Skowronski’s team collected data from nearly 247,000 people in B.C. from May 30 – Sept. 11, coinciding with the rise of the Delta variant. Two doses of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 98 per cent effective at preventing hospitalizations, while AstraZeneca was 93 per cent effective, according to the data. “It’s important to remember that the goal of the COVID-19 vaccination program is not to eliminate the virus,” she said. “The goal of the program is to minimize hospitalizations, deaths, and severe outcomes.” “We’re not concerned if people have the sniffles,” she said.

The Canadian experience is a unique one. Many provinces elected to space out first and second doses by up to four months. Skowronski said this move had an impact on the durability of the vaccine — and in turn, our need for a booster. “It does appear to have optimized the second dose protection in the fall, now when we most need it,” she said.

Extending the dose interval Back in Montreal, Kaufmann and Finzi’s teams also found that extending the dose interval to 16 weeks elicited a strong immune response. “The dosing interval is actually a critical component of the immune response being generated by these vaccines,” Finzi said. While some studies point to waning antibodies over time, Kaufmann said that B-cells and T-cells continue to work together to stave off severe disease after the vaccine is administered. These cells can remain “dormant” for periods of time, but will spring into action if they see a harmful pathogen. “The memory cells wake up and then begin to produce antibodies again,” Kaufmann said. “They can do that very rapidly and very efficiently.” View image in full screen

Safety concerns As countries assess the need for boosters, policymakers are also weighing safety concerns. Advertisement A review published last month in the Lancet, by a group of international scientists, which included departing F.D.A. officials, sharply criticized the push for boosters on several fronts. It highlighted the health risks if boosters are introduced widely too soon, or too frequently, including rare side-effects like myocarditis — an inflammation of the heart muscle — which has been documented following first and second mRNA doses. “If unnecessary boosting causes significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 vaccines,” the authors said. “Widespread boosting should be undertaken only if there is clear evidence that it is appropriate.” 1:01 CDC director says withholding access to 3rd COVID-19 shot for people in high-risk settings would ‘worsen inequalities’ CDC director says withholding access to 3rd COVID-19 shot for people in high-risk settings would ‘worsen inequalities’ – Sep 24, 2021 The scientists analyzed dozens of studies and said none of the preliminary data or studies provide “credible evidence of substantially declining protection against severe disease.” Both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech say they saw no serious side effects, like myocarditis, in their clinical trials of boosters. However, Ontario took steps this week to recommend Pfizer-BioNTech shots over Moderna for those aged 18 to 24 “out of an abundance of caution”. The province said between June and August the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for men aged 18 to 24 following a second dose of Moderna was one in 5,000. There have been no fatalities. The risk for people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was one in 28,000, according to the province. Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, said Moderna’s elevated risk is “very mild” and he had “complete confidence” in the vaccine."

A joint European-Japanese spacecraft got its first glimpse of Mercury as it swung by the solar system’s innermost planet while on a mission to deliver two probes into orbit in 2025.

The BepiColombo mission made the first of six flybys of Mercury at 11:34 p.m. GMT (7:34 p.m. EST) Friday, using the planet’s gravity to slow the spacecraft down.

After swooping past Mercury at altitudes of under 200 kilometers (125 miles), the spacecraft took a low resolution black-and-white photo with one of its monitoring cameras before zipping off again.

The European Space Agency said the captured image shows the Northern Hemisphere and Mercury’s characteristic pock-marked features, among them the 166-kilometer-wide (103-mile-wide) Lermontov crater.

 

The joint mission by the European agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency was launched in 2018, flying once past Earth and twice past Venus on its journey to the solar system’s smallest planet.

“When (employers) see your photo or your age or your tenure or your education timeframe, I find, like, instantaneously you get an email saying, ‘You have great experience and but we’re going with another candidate.'”

Di Biase is 60 and that, she believes, is hobbling her job search.

Canada is facing a historical labour shortage. In the middle of the summer, employers in accommodation and food services alone were trying to fill 132,800 jobs, accounting for the highest job vacancy rate the industry has ever seen (11.6 per cent).

Retail trade has the second-largest number of job vacancies in July (101,300), and the health-care and social assistance sector was staring at a whopping 97,800 positions, according to Statistics Canada.

And yet, some older workers, like Di Biase, say they can’t get callbacks.

Older workers struggling to re-enter labour market in the pandemic

Age-based discrimination in the workplace was widespread in Canada even before the COVID-19 pandemic, says Ellie Berger, an associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Nipissing University and author of Ageism at Work: Deconstructing Age and Gender in the Discriminating Labour Market.

Story continues below advertisement

Companies often exclude employees aged 55 and up for promotions and training opportunities, says Berger, who’s been researching the issue for more than 25 years. But it’s really when older workers lose their job and have to try to find a new one that workplace ageism takes the heaviest toll, she says.

In one longitudinal study spanning several years, Berger found older workers who’d experience prolonged joblessness often experienced depression and other mental health issues, a phenomenon she calls “identity degradation.”

“They’re feeling this feeling of being degraded, being considered old and useless,” she says. And that state of mind, in turn, hampers workers’ ability to find new employment, she says.

Pandemic-related layoffs may have left more Canadians struggling with age bias as they struggle to rejoin the workforce, according to Berger, who says she has heard anecdotally of companies laying off older and higher-paid staff as a cost-cutting measure in the earlier stages of the health emergency. But now that employers are hiring again, many are keen to replace senior employees with lower-paid, younger workers, she says.

Berger says she has served as an expert witness on a couple of recent ageism cases with the Ontario Human Rights Commission and expects the volume of lawsuits centred around age discrimination to increase.

But older workers struggling with ageism also include some who decided to quit or retire early in the pandemic, says Kathryn Meisner, a Toronto-based career and salary negotiation coach.

Read more: Why looking for a new job now could be a big payoff

Pandemic-related job upheaval has prompted some baby boomers in sectors like health care and the airline industry to pull the trigger on early retirement, for example.

Meisner says she’s seen some clients who quickly rethought that decision either because they realized they weren’t ready to stop working or because they found out they couldn’t afford it. Often, though, re-entering the labour force is an uphill struggle for those aged 55 and over, she says.

It doesn’t help that, in Canada and other countries, the pandemic has also triggered a resignation boom, with record numbers of workers pursuing new careers and opportunities.

“(Older workers) are competing against a new crop of people, usually younger people,” says Meisner.

What job candidates can do about ageism

If you’re worried about ageism, keep in mind that common tactics to avoid revealing your age — such as omitting school graduation dates in your resume — may backfire, says Berger.

Story continues below advertisement

“When I spoke to employers … they actually talked about that being a red flag of being an older person if there is no date on the resume,” she says.

Applying for jobs for which you’re overqualified also tends not to work, as employers will often feel like you’re not a good fit, Meisner says. Instead, whether you’re trying to make a lateral move or switch careers, you should focus on working your professional network.

“Those are people who know you,” she says. “Oftentimes they are willing to help you.”

It’s also important to freshen up and tailor your resume. With algorithms often in charge of taking the first crack at sifting through job applications, a resume that doesn’t include the right keywords may never be seen by a flesh-and-bone hiring manager, Meisner warns.

And if you’ve been out of a job since before the pandemic work-from-home boom, make sure you’re comfortable using the technology that supports remote work, such as video calls and workplace chat applications.

For her part, Di Biase says she was using Zoom before the pandemic and has always been tech-savvy.

Her long spell of unemployment is throwing a wrench into her family’s financial plans. With two children who are going to get married soon, she and her husband, who is retired, will have to tighten the purse strings, she says. Helping the kids buy a house, for example, doesn’t seem feasible anymore.

Still, she isn’t ready to take down the picture on her LinkedIn profile just because it shows her age, she says.

“I want to work for someone who wants (my) knowledge,” she adds.

In the meantime, she has become a certified life coach and recently took on her first client. While she continues to look for a job in client services, being a life coach could become the fall-back plan, she says.

“I get joy from it,” she says."
Stewart Bell,Global News,11/28/2017," 

On Sunday, Oct. 4, 2020, a Canadian government delegation crossed the Tigris River into northeast Syria to take custody of a five-year-old orphan.

Amira was the only survivor of a Canadian family killed by an airstrike during the fight against ISIS, to which her parents had allegedly belonged.

A year later, internal documents released to Global News under the Access to Information Act describe the months of discussions that preceded the handover.

They show Canadian officials knew about Amira in April 2019, located her that December, and in February 2020 were invited by U.S.-backed Kurdish authorities to come get her.

But Canadian officials instead spent months exchanging memos over what to do, and insisting northeast Syria wasn’t safe for them to visit, the documents show.

 

While the U.S. and other countries were sending delegations to the region, Canadian officials wrote that they weren’t allowed to, citing “federal legislation and the Canadian Labour Code.”

The documents show Canadian officials wanted “alternate solutions” for getting Amira that did not involve crossing into Syria, before finally sending a delegation to bring her out.

“The situation is complex and COVID-19 has made it even more difficult,” one document read.

Global Affairs Canada did not directly respond when asked why it took 18 months to get Amira out of Syria.

Asked why the government had not repatriated the roughly three dozen Canadians, mostly children, still at camps for ISIS captives, a spokesperson cited “the security situation on the ground.”

But Ottawa lawyer Lawrence Greenspon said the declassified documents undermined the government’s position.

Greenspon, who represents the families of many of the detainees, said the documents showed Canadian officials could engage diplomatically with the Kurdish authorities and safely enter northeast Syria.

“This is exactly what we have asked them to do in regards to the 30-some men, women and children who are still there,” said Greenspon.

On Monday, Greenspon filed a case in the Federal Court on behalf of the families, accusing the government of failing to bring them home.

The documents show that Global Affairs Canada first learned about Amira shortly after ISIS had been ousted from its last stronghold in Baghuz, near the Iraqi border.

Amira’s uncle, who lives in Canada, contacted Canadian consular officials in April 2019 for help bringing her to Canada.

In May, consular officials began contacting Kurdish authorities “to inquire about the whereabouts of the child.”

She was found at Al-Hol Camp, a sprawling detention facility for women and children captured during the fight against ISIS.

The uncle tried to bring her back himself, but the Kurds “would only hand Amira over to a Canadian delegation,” a memo said.

In February 2020, Canadian officials “established Amira’s identity and determined that she is entitled to Canadian citizenship,” a memo said.

 

“They did this based on e-mails and photos provided.”

Global Affairs Canada sent a letter to the Kurdish authorities on Feb. 11, 2020 saying, “we would be supportive of her repatriation should they agree to release her into the custody of her uncle.”

The Kurds, however, would “only hand her over to a Canadian delegation that visited their region and followed Kurdish protocols for release (e.g. meetings, signing documents).”

But the Canadian government took the position that Syria was a no-go zone.

Although NGOs, journalists and delegations from other governments had travelled to the Kurdish-held northeast, Ottawa considered it too risky for its officials.

A memo said Canada would not send its employees “for safety and security reasons,” adding the assessment was based partly on the Canadian Labour Code.

“Countries have different foreign policy and different presence and activities in the region. Each government does their own assessments involving a range of considerations,” it explained.

Rather, Canada was continuing to “advocate for her safety and well-being” while exploring “alternate solutions to secure Amira’s release and travel to Canada,” the documents said.

 

By then, a year had passed, and the global pandemic brought a new complication to the case.

At a briefing on June 5, 2020, Canadian officials agreed to set up a working group to develop “operational plans in the coming weeks that will be presented to senior officials for consideration.”

Canada sent a letter to the Kurds on June 8, 2020 signalling “Canada’s desire to resolve Amira’s situation and discuss the requirements necessary to secure her repatriation.”

But the Kurds had already made it clear what Canada had to do: a delegation would have to visit northeast Syria, sign a repatriation agreement and take custody of Amira.

An assistant deputy minister at Global Affairs Canada, however, “wanted to work with the Kurds to find a way to support Amira’s exit from Syria that did not require a crossover into northeast Syria.”

 

“She asked whether a handover on the Iraqi side of the Syria-Iraq border would be possible,” according to a June 25 memo.

The Kurds insisted it had to happen on their territory.

Meanwhile, other countries were bringing out their citizens without incident. “We learned that, over the weekend, the French repatriated 10 orphans and unaccompanied children,” a memo noted.

A month later, Canadian officials had come up with two options to be presented to their superiors “for review and discussion on the way forward.”

Adding new pressure was an application filed in the Federal Court by Amira’s uncle, who was seeking an order to force the government to bring his niece to Canada.

The decision to send an official delegation to Syria was made on Sept. 11, 2020. The Canadian Armed Forces was to provide support for the delegation.

A “detailed operational plan” was put together, and Canadian military representatives in Iraq advised their contacts, while the composition of the delegation was being finalized.

“We are currently working on a four-week timeline,” read a secret memo.

Video posted on Twitter by Abdulkarim Omar, the Kurdish foreign minister, showed the Canadians arriving at a government building just minutes from the Iraqi border on Oct. 4, 2020.

 

Headed by Gregory Galligan, Canada’s executive co-ordinator for Syria, they sat with Kurdish officials and signed a document before departing with the then-five-year-old Canadian.

National security law expert Leah West said the documents showed the government had made the decision to repatriate Amira, come up with options and executed the plan without incident.

They also showed Canadian officials had strong lines of communication with the Kurdish authorities who control northeast Syria, said West, who teaches at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.

“Nothing in the documents makes me believe the security concerns were the fundamental reason for choosing whether or not to repatriate Amira,” said West, who visited the Syrian camps in 2019.

“There was no obvious change in the circumstances that flipped the answer from red to green. The only reference to security appeared to be the talking points prepared for her family.”

Since Amira’s return, a second Canadian girl has left Syria, handed over this time to a former U.S. diplomat, who also later secured the release of her mother.

Greenspon said he was aware of about 20 Canadian children who remained at the camps, along with about 10 women, while three or four Canadian men are detained by the Kurds.

In a report last week, Save the Children said Canada was among the countries that “have not done enough to repatriate their citizens” from the camps.

 

“In recent months, countries including Germany, Finland and Belgium completed the repatriation of a group of mothers and children from the camps, proving again that it is possible to save lives when there is political will,” the report said.

Leslie Young,Global News,11/28/2017,"It didn’t take long for Bill Mahfouz to face customer backlash over Ontario’s new proof-of-vaccine requirements, which came into effect last week.

On Sept. 22, the first day the province required restaurants to ask for proof of COVID-19 vaccination for everyone who was dining indoors, the second or third customer of Benny’s All Day family restaurant in Rockland, Ont., became aggressive, according to Mahfouz.

“I was in the back and he had a confrontation with the server in front, and he refused to show anything and, you know, started spouting off anti-vaccine, anti-mask regulations and all that and started screaming and yelling and then became offensive,” said Mahfouz, the restaurant’s owner.

“I got to the front and he was swearing and got physical, slammed the door – almost broke it,” he said.

“I met him outside on the patio. And then he threatened to come back and fill up his truck with bricks and destroy the place.”

Mahfouz said that this was one isolated incident and most customers have been co-operative, but he doesn’t like that his young staff and servers have to deal with these problems.

“That’s my biggest concern. I want to protect my staff first and foremost,” he said.

“Most of the time we have 16-year-old hostesses. And that’s just not OK. Nobody should be abused.”

Many small business owners have concerns about proof-of-vaccination systems, said Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB).

“Business owners are very worried about basically becoming the vaccine police,” he said.

“We’ve had some restaurant owners let us know that there are actually operating in fear right now.”

“One restaurant owner told us that in fact, she has she refused to open her restaurant until the rest of her staff arrived because the previous day there was an altercation with a customer that was very unhappy about being refused service. These are the very real situations business owners are finding themselves in. And it’s not pretty.”

It’s not just customer confrontations that have restaurant owners worried.

“We’ve had a couple of incidents at the door, just making sure that we are checking IDs, and unfortunately, we were not able to look after them,” Rieley Kay, co-owner of Cilantro and Chive in Lacombe, Alta., said.

“The most negative feedback we’ve got has been online, on the phone or through the mail. It’s people that aren’t coming through our doors.”

Some restaurants have decided not to open at all. The Langdon Firehouse Bar & Grill in Langdon, Alta., temporarily shut its doors to in-person dining after its staff were threatened online.

“We made the decision to close because the comments that were coming at us were significant enough that we didn’t feel confident or safe in opening the doors and having our staff deal with this backlash,” co-owner Aleesha Gosling told Global News last week.

The restaurant has since reopened to fully vaccinated guests, with security staff in place, according to its Facebook page.

He said he wishes the provincial government had prepared businesses better for the change.

“They didn’t really put a lot of thought into it,” he said, adding that waiting until a planned provincial app was ready would have made things easier.

“Now we have to hire more staff and take a chance that they might get verbally abused or physically. And it’s tough stuff for that first month.”

Ontario Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton said at a press conference Monday that the government “continue(s) to put out supports and tools to businesses.” He pointed to a toll-free number for workers concerned about workplace safety (1-877-202-0008) and inspectors taking an “education-first” approach with businesses.

“To the public out there, please just treat all of these workers with respect that they deserve because they’ve been through an awful lot in the last 18 or 19 months,” he said.

Governments are “pushing more and more public health responsibilities down to the business owner,” Kelly said. “They now have the costs of screening unvaccinated people out of their businesses. They have to take the risks associated with this.”

“If people are unhappy, they should be raising that with their elected politicians, not the poor business owner that basically is hanging on by their fingernails and is being required by law to implement new government legislation.”

Mahfouz agrees.

“You have anger issues with this law or this mandate or whatever you want to call it? Take it up with your MPP, your MP. Don’t take it out on us,” he said. “We’re just following the law.”

After spending nearly three years in Chinese detention, Canadian Michael Kovrig is delighted to be back in Toronto and reunited with his family.

Kovrig, a former diplomat, along with businessman Michael Spavor, touched down on home soil on Saturday following their release from China – in an apparent prisoner swap after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was allowed to return to Shenzhen following a plea deal with the U.S.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced the two men upon their arrival at the Calgary airport early Saturday.

After exchanging hugs with the prime minister and bidding goodbye to his fellow captive, Kovrig then boarded another plane bound for Toronto, where his wife Vina Nadjibulla and sister Ariana Botha greeted him with emotional embraces on the tarmac.

The West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson spoke to Kovrig and his wife at his sister’s home in Toronto hours after landing.

“It was really moving and knowing that so many people knew about the situation, cared about the situation, really helped us get through a very difficult time,” said Kovrig.

“I just want to say thank you very much to all Canadians for the enormous support and all of the effort that so many people have made to help bring Michael Spavor and me home,” he added.

Nadjibulla expressed gratitude and relief for seeing him back home safe and healthy. The couple separated in 2017 but Nadjibulla had been leading efforts to obtain his release.

 

“It has been an incredible day,” she told Global News. “I’m speechless.”

“Just two weeks ago, we walked for them – 7,000 steps to their freedom – and here they are, free at last in Canada.”

On Sept. 5, families and supporters of the “Two Michaels” walked 7,000 steps – the same amount Kovrig took in his windowless concrete prison cell every day – through Ottawa, from Windsor Park to Major’s Hill Park, to mark 1,000 days of their detention.

Kovrig and Spavor’s safe return to Canada marks an end to a tense international standoff surrounding the U.S. extradition case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.

Just as Spavor and Kovrig took off from a Chinese airport late Friday, Meng was making her way back to China from Vancouver after resolving the legal saga that mired all three of them in a geopolitical melee.

 

The case connecting their fates came to an abrupt conclusion when Meng, the chief financial officer at Huawei Technologies and the daughter of the telecom’s founder, reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors over fraud and conspiracy charges related to American sanctions against Iran.

Meng’s arrest in Vancouver in December 2018 at the behest of the U.S. has been a source of simmering tensions between Ottawa, Washington and Beijing.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested in China just days after Meng’s apprehension in apparent retaliation.

The two men were convicted on espionage charges in separate trials earlier this year. Spavor was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month, while a sentence had yet to be issued for Kovrig.

China has publicly maintained that there is no connection between her case and the men’s imprisonment but had also dropped broad hints that her freedom could benefit the two Canadians.

 

Canada repeatedly demanded China release the pair, saying they were arbitrarily detained on bogus charges.

Trudeau also consistently ruled out a prisoner swap, trading Meng for the “Two Michaels,” despite pressure from several former Canadian diplomats and parliamentarians.

Back in Toronto, Kovrig is now looking forward to putting all that behind him, reconnecting with friends and family and “seeing all the beauty of Canada.”

 

Nadjibulla said it was a time to heal and rest.

“We brought them home and this is because of all the Canadians who have been with us every step of the way,” she said.

When asked how they planned to celebrate the day, Kovrig said: “I’m running on about two hours of sleep in the last 24-plus hours, so I don’t have any exciting plans just yet.”

As fall kicks off and winter approaches, Canadian snowbirds are busy planning their trips down south with greater interest this year.

While the threat of COVID-19 in Canada and the U.S. is far from over amid the spread of the Delta variant, there is an increased demand to travel compared to last year, travel insurance experts say.

“There’s a pent-up demand for Canadians to travel outside of Canada, particularly to the U.S.,” said Pamela Kwiatkowski, co-founder and vice president of Goose Insurance.

Since August, she said, they have seen increased activity with sales continuing to grow every day as Canadians plan and book their travel.

 

For now, Canadians can get to the U.S. by air, as the land border closure – imposed since March 2020 – will remain in effect until at least Oct. 21.

That creates a few problems for those who were hoping to drive down to sunny U.S. destinations and escape Canada’s harsh winter cold.

2:02 COVID-19 travel measures critisized by Canadian snowbirds COVID-19 travel measures critisized by Canadian snowbirds – Feb 22, 2021

Martin Firestone, a Toronto-based travel insurance broker, said his snowbird clients typically start making their way to Florida, Arizona, California and Texas in October and stay until April.

Their biggest concern, he said, is why they are unable to drive in their own cars but are allowed to fly with 300 other people in an airplane.

“The bottom line is those who want to leave prior to Oct. 21 are not going anywhere and they are going to now wait for the next 30 days and see what happens then,” Firestone told Global News.

 

“The hopes of 90 per cent of the snowbirds returning down south may diminish down to 50 per cent if they can’t drive down and take their vehicles with them because I think for many it would be a very costly factor to follow up with any of the options.”

Canada reopened its land border to fully vaccinated Americans back in August.

American travellers who are fully vaccinated don’t have to quarantine upon arrival in Canada, but they’re required to show a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival and provide proof of vaccination by way of the ArriveCAN smartphone app or web portal.

Currently, there is no vaccine requirement for air travellers to the U.S. But starting in November, all passengers entering the U.S. will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken at least 72 hours prior to boarding and certification of their double vaccination status.

Some are now wondering whether the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which is not approved in the U.S., will even be accepted.

“There’s some concern there as to how that’s going to be handled,” said Firestone.

Daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have dropped since the start of September but deaths are soaring – averaging more than 1,500 per day.

 

Travel insurance experts strongly recommend Canadians, especially the more vulnerable older population, get fully vaccinated before they head south.

Kwiatkowski said that since provincial health coverage does not apply to any emergency medical services and hospitalizations while travelling, it is important for snowbirds to buy an insurance policy that includes COVID-19-related expenses.

They should also make sure that besides medical expenses, their policy covers costs incurred if they have to cancel a trip, quarantine or delay their return, she said.

“One day in the hospital can cost you $10,000 to $50,000 and no one wants to pay that price.”

Firestone said more than 90 per cent of his clients are interested in travelling to the U.S. this year – up from around 30 per cent last year.

 

He said many have already booked their trips and made arrangements of where they will stay.

“Their attitude is ‘life is short. I was away one year from this place. I’m going this year regardless.’”

Ellen Knickmeyer,The Associated Press,11/28/2017,"The first Women’s March of the Biden administration heads straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests demanding continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy.

Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice” and cheering loudly to the beat of drums.

Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said “Mind your own uterus,” “I love someone who had an abortion” and “Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,” among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply “1973,” a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal for generations of American women.

Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. “It’s sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it’s a tradition I want to continue,” Baijal said of the march.

Organizers say the Washington march was among hundreds of abortion-themed protests held around the country Saturday. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term for the Supreme Court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court.

“Shame, shame, shame!” marchers chanted while walking past the Trump International Hotel on their way to the Supreme Court. Some booed and waived their fists at the Trump landmark.

The day before the march, the Biden administration urged a federal judge to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September. It’s one of a series of cases that will give the nation’s divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v. Wade.

The Texas law motivated many of the demonstrators and speakers.

“We’re going to keep giving it to Texas,” Marsha Jones of the Afiya Center for Black women’s health care in Dallas, pledged to the Washington crowd. “You can no longer tell us what to do with our bodies!”

Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood nationally, told of women forced to drive many hours across state lines _ sometimes multiple state lines _ to end pregnancies in the weeks since the Texas law went into effect.

“The moment is dark … but that is why we are here,” Johnson told the crowd packed into Freedom Square and surrounding streets. With the upcoming Supreme Court term, “No matter where you are, this fight is at your doorstep right now.”

In Springfield, Illinois, several hundred people rallied on the Old State Capitol square. Prominent among them were the Illinois Handmaids, wearing red robes and white bonnets reminiscent of the automatons of Margaret Atwood’s classic tale and carrying signs that said, “Mind Your Own Uterus” and “Mother By Choice.”

Brigid Leahy, senior director of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Illinois, said just two days after the Texas restrictions took effect, Planned Parenthood saw the first women from Texas traveling to Illinois for the procedure, with more following since.

“They are trying to figure out paying for airfare or gas or a train ticket, they may need hotel and meals. …,” Leahy said. “They have to figure out time off of work, and they have to figure out child care. This can be a real struggle.”

With a sign reading “Not this again” attached to a clothes hangar, Gretchen Snow of Bloomington, Illinois, said, “Women need to be safe and they need to not have to worry about how much money they have to be safe.”

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke at rallies in Seneca Falls and then Albany. “I’m sick and tired of having to fight over abortion rights,” she said. “It’s settled law in the nation and you are not taking that right away from us, not now not ever.”

At an unrelated event in Maine, Republican Sen. Susan Collins called the Texas law “extreme, inhumane and unconstitutional” and said she’s working to make Roe v. Wade the “law of the land.”

She said she’s working with two Democrats and another Republican, and they’re “vetting” the language of their bill. Collins declined to identify her colleagues, but said the legislation will be introduced soon.

An opponent of women’s access to abortion called this year’s march theme “macabre.”

“What about equal rights for unborn women?” tweeted Jeanne Mancini, president of an anti-abortion group called March for Life.

The Women’s March has become a regular event _ although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic _ since millions of women turned out in the United States and around the world the day after the January 2017 inauguration of Trump. Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency.

With the sun beating down Saturday, Ramsay Teviotdale of Arlington, Virginia _ who when asked her age said she was “old enough to remember when abortion wasn’t legal” _ was one of the few wearing the hand-knitted pink wool caps that distinguished the 2017 Women’s March.

Without Trump as a central figure for women of varied political beliefs to rally against, and with the pandemic still going strong, organizers talked of hundreds of thousands of participants nationally Saturday, not the millions of 2017.

Teviotdale said this does not lessen the urgency of the moment. “This Texas thing _ no way can it stand. It’s the thin edge of the wedge,” she said.

Latina comedian and activist Cristela Alonzo hosted Saturday’s rally in Washington, which featured speeches from many advocates and providers of abortion. Actress Busy Philipps and swimmer Schuyler Bailar were to take part.

Security in the capital was much lighter than for a political rally a few weeks ago in support of Trump supporters jailed in the Jan. 6 insurrection. No fence was placed around the U.S. Capitol, with the Capitol Police chief saying there was nothing to suggest Saturday’s rally would be violent.

Authorities advised people to limit time outdoors in parts of La Palma on Saturday as the erupting volcano on the Spanish island spewed red-hot lava and thick clouds of black smoke.

However emergency services lifted a stay-home order that had been in effect in Los Llanos de Aridane, El Paso and areas of Tazacorte, places near the volcano that had been affected by poor air quality.

“In response to the improvement in air quality measurements in the area, the lockdown in Tazacorte, El Paso and Los Llanos de Aridane will be lifted,” the services said in a statement.

They advised people to continue to avoid spending a “prolonged amount of time” outside, and said vulnerable groups including children and the elderly should remain indoors.

 

The Cumbre Vieja volcano began its fiery eruption on Sept. 19 and has destroyed more than 800 buildings.

About 6,000 people have been evacuated from their homes on the island, which has a population of about 83,000 and is one of an archipelago making up the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.

On Friday, lava flowed from a new vent in the volcano, which the Canaries Volcanology Institute described as a new “focus of eruption.”

The volcano was experiencing “intense activity,” Miguel Angel Morcuende, director of the Pevolca response committee, told a news conference on Friday. But he also put the eruption into the context of the wider island.

“Less than 8 per cent of the island is affected by the volcano. The rest is leading a normal life,” he said.

Daria Litvinova,The Associated Press,11/28/2017,"When Russians talk about the coronavirus over dinner or in hair salons, the conversation often turns to “antitela,” the Russian word for antibodies — the proteins produced by the body to fight infection.

Even President Vladimir Putin referred to them this week in a conversation with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, bragging about why he avoided infection even though dozens of people around him caught the coronavirus, including someone who spent a whole day with the Kremlin leader.

“I have high titers,” Putin said, referring to the measurement used to describe the concentration of antibodies in the blood. When Erdogan challenged him that the number Putin gave was low, the Russian insisted, “No, it’s a high level. There are different counting methods.”

But Western health experts say the antibody tests so popular in Russia are unreliable either for diagnosing COVID-19 or assessing immunity to it. The antibodies that these tests look for can only serve as evidence of a past infection, and scientists say it’s still unclear what level of antibodies indicates protection from the virus and for how long.

The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention says such tests should not be used to establish an active COVID-19 infection because it can take one to three weeks for the body to make antibodies. Health experts say tests that look for the virus’s genetic material, called PCR tests, or ones that look for virus proteins, called antigen tests, should be used to determine if someone is infected.

In Russia, it’s common to get an antibody test and share the results. The tests are cheap, widely available and actively marketed by private clinics nationwide, and their use appears to be a factor in the country’s low vaccination rate even as daily deaths and infections are rising again.

In Moscow and the surrounding region, millions of antibody tests have been done at state-run clinics that offered them for free. Across the country, dozens of chains of private labs and clinics also offer a wide variety of antibody tests for COVID-19, as well as tests for other medical conditions.

“In some cities I went to, I needed to take a PCR test and it wasn’t possible, but I could take an antibody test — it was much easier,” said Dr. Anton Barchuk, head of the epidemiology group at the European University in St. Petersburg and an associate professor at the Petrov National Cancer Center there.

Antibody tests for COVID-19 were first widely publicized in Moscow in May 2020, shortly after Russia lifted its only nationwide lockdown, although many restrictions remained in place. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an ambitious program to test tens of thousands of residents for antibodies.

Many Muscovites greeted this enthusiastically. Contrary to Western experts, some believed antibodies represented immunity from the virus and saw a positive test as a way out of restrictions.

The test looked at two different types of antibodies: ones that appear in one’s system soon after infection, and ones that take weeks to develop. To their surprise, some of those who tested positive for the former were handed a COVID-19 diagnosis and ordered to quarantine.

Irina Umarova, 56, spent 22 days confined to her studio apartment, without experiencing any symptoms. Visiting doctors took six PCR tests that came back negative. But they also took more antibody tests, which continued to show a certain level of antibodies.

“They kept telling me I was infected and needed to stay home,” she said.

More interest in antibody testing came this summer when Russia had a surge of infections. The demand for tests spiked so sharply that labs were overwhelmed and some ran out of supplies.

That’s when dozens of regions made vaccinations mandatory for certain groups of people and restricted access to various public spaces, allowing in only those who were vaccinated, had had the virus, or had tested negative for it recently.

Daria Goryakina, deputy director at the Helix Laboratory Service, a large chain of testing facilities, said she believed the increased interest in antibody testing was connected to the vaccination mandates.

In the second half of June, Helix performed 230% more antibody tests than in the first half, and the high demand continued into the first week of July. “People want to check their antibody levels and whether they need to get vaccinated,” Goryakina told The Associated Press.

Both the World Health Organization and the CDC recommend vaccination regardless of previous infection.

Guidance in Russia has varied, with authorities initially saying that those testing positive for the antibodies weren’t eligible for the shot, but then urging everyone to get vaccinated regardless of their antibody levels. Still, some Russians believed a positive antibody test was a reason to put off vaccination.

Maria Bloquert recovered from the coronavirus in May, and a test she took shortly after revealed a high antibody count. She has put off her vaccination but wants to get it eventually, once her antibody levels start to wane. “As long as my antibody titers are high, I have protection from the virus, and there is no point in getting injected with more protection on top of it,” the 37-year-old Muscovite told AP.

High-profile officials, like Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, both have been quoted as saying they didn’t need to get vaccinated due to having high levels of antibodies, but they eventually decided to get their shots.

Contradicting guidelines may have contributed to Russia’s low vaccination rate, said Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva, leader of the Alliance of Doctors union.

“People don’t understand (what to do), because they’re constantly given different versions” of recommendations, she said.

Even though Russia boasted of creating the world’s first vaccine, Sputnik V, only 32.5 per cent of its 146 million people have gotten at least one shot, and only 28 per cent are fully vaccinated. Critics have principally blamed a botched vaccine rollout and mixed messages the authorities have been sending about the outbreak.

Dr. Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading in England, said antibody tests shouldn’t influence any health-related decisions.

Getting an antibody test “is for your own personal satisfaction and curiosity,” he added.

Barchuk, the St. Petersburg epidemiologist, echoed his sentiment, saying there are too many gaps in understanding how antibodies work, and the tests offer little information beyond past infection.

But some Russian regions disregarded that advice, using positive antibody tests to allow people access to restaurants, bars and other public places on par with a vaccination certificate or a negative coronavirus test. Some people get an antibody test before or after vaccination to make sure the shot worked or see if they need a booster.

Dr. Vasily Vlassov, an epidemiologist and a public health expert with the Higher School of Economics, says this attitude reflects Russians’ distrust of the state-run health care system and their struggle to navigate the confusion amid the pandemic.

“People’s attempt to find a rational way of acting, to base their decision on something, for example the antibodies, is understandable — the situation is difficult and bewildering,” Vlassov said. “And they opt for a method that’s available for them rather than for a good one. Because there is no good method to make sure that you have immunity.”

Victoria Bakos,Global News,11/28/2017,"Andrea Rovere was fatally struck while riding his bike on Sept. 27 heading South on Parc Avenue, at the corner of Mont-Royal Avenue.

This is the 15th ghost bike installed by Velo Fantome this year, and seven of them involved a collision with a heavy-duty truck.

A ghost bike is a bicycle painted white that is left at the exact spot where a cyclist died as a result of a road collision. It is a roadside memorial dedicated to the life of the deceased individual, intended to remind us of the dangers caused by motor vehicles and by deficient urban infrastructure.

“The blind spots on trucks are horrible, the trucks are much too big, we see this with SUVs and heavy-duty trucks, […] even though there’s a speed limit, nobody respects it,” said Severine Lepage, spokesperson for Velo Fantome Montreal.

Justice Minister and Minister Responsible for the French Language Simon Jolin-Barrette issued a statement today saying the funding will support 12 associations that work on the integration of immigrants in developing projects to strengthen their use of French.

Jolin-Barrette says French skills are essential for immigrants in order to be a part of Quebec society.

The earlier phase of the pandemic was a rough ride for Maggie DeVito. The 26-year old Vancouver-based former bartender says she was out of work for months amid repeated restaurant shutdowns and COVID-19 restrictions.

So when her former employer had to temporarily lay her off again after the summer of 2020, she started thinking about a radical career change, she says.

Roughly a year later, DeVito is working as a full-stack developer for a record label, working on the company’s site and building and designing websites for its artists as well.

The job is “super interesting,” she says. “And I get a little sneak peek into the music industry.”

 

Her hourly pay has jumped to $25 an hour before tax, a significant increase from the $15-$20 an hour with tips she used to make as a bartender. And unlike her previous job, there is no uncertainty about how much she’ll earn every week.

Even better, DeVito was able to pull off the dramatic professional pivot with just three months of schooling.

'We've doubled our student base'

Robert Furtado, who heads CourseCompare, a website that compares courses and training programs in a variety of industries, says his staff often hear from prospective job-switchers who assume they’ll need a four-year degree in computer science to land a job in tech.

 

“The reality is, if you’re interested in becoming a web developer, for example, you should pursue all avenues,” Furtado says.

These days, that includes free online learning options on YouTube; GitHub, the open-source software development community; and coding boot camps, a new breed of post-secondary school that promises to churn out office-ready IT workers in just a few months.

The latter is what DeVito did, enrolling in a 12-week web-developer course at Lighthouse Labs that started in January. Within a few months of finishing school she landed the job at the record company, she says.

The shortage of IT workers in Canada, which was already acute before the pandemic, has become even more severe, says Jonathan Ward, president of tech-focused recruiting and staffing agency Ward Technology Talent.

“In the past 20 years, this is the craziest I’ve seen it in terms of the shortage of workers,” he says.

Some companies recruiting for mid- and senior-level positions have had to shorten their hiring cycle to five business days to be able to snatch up in-demand candidates, he says.

And salaries are so competitive that some IT candidates with coveted skills are commanding salaries that are higher than what their own hiring managers make, he adds.

 

2:01 Employers feeling the pinch as balance of power shifts to employees Employers feeling the pinch as balance of power shifts to employees – Jul 9, 2021

“The pandemic has clearly accelerated our use of digital technologies for everything from banking to shopping for groceries,” Furtado says. And that has sent companies in virtually every industry scrambling to beef up their IT staff.

Because of the shortage, firms are also more prepared to hire entry-level candidates, Shaki says.

“Beforehand there (were) a lot of companies that (would) still wait to find that one magic person that they (could) find at the price point they (wanted). And now companies are coming up with much better staffing solutions that include retaining and training younger entry-level talent and helping them move forwards,” he says.

Furtado says many large employers in both the private and public sectors have dropped degree requirements for a number of IT positions.

But the pandemic is also drawing more workers to the tech sector.

 

At CourseCompare web traffic related to technology careers and courses was up 178 per cent in September 2021 compared to the same month in 2019, according to Furtado.

And enrolments have soared throughout the pandemic at Lighthouse Labs, according to Shaki.

“We’ve doubled our student base since the beginning of 2020,” he says.

Shaki attributes that at least in part to the fact that Lighthouse Labs was quick to establish a COVID-19 Relief Scholarship for workers affected by the job losses linked to the pandemic.

Since March 2020, the company says it has made $1 million in scholarship funding available to students. Currently, it offers $750 toward its part-time course and $3,000 toward its full-time programs, according to its website. The courses cost up to $13,000 for a full-time, 12-week class.

 

DeVito was among those who took advantage of the scholarship, without which she would have had to push back her enrolment to save up, she says.

She was still able to put down $2,000 of her own savings and covered the rest with a government student loan, she says.

Even before going back to school, the pandemic, she says, had forced her to rack up credit card debt.

“I had just paid it off right before COVID,” she says.

Now, though, she makes enough money to get back on track financially.

“I’ve been able to save up,” she says. “I’ve been able to start working on getting out of debt that I acquired throughout COVID and pay off my student loan as well.”"
Anne Gaviola,Global News,11/28/2017,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Karen Wright did something she’s never done before: she bought a home without ever seeing it in person.

“I was Google strolling about and I discovered a Victorian house on a big corner lot and it just really appealed to me. There was something about it that drew me to it,” she told Global News.

Back in 2020, the executive coach and empty nester found herself craving more space beyond the 900-square-foot midtown Toronto condo she lived in.

“When the pandemic hit, I found myself spending 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a very small space,” she said. “I was feeling a need for community and access to nature and the outdoors.”

Her search led her to the town of Bridgewater, N.S., with a population of about 8,600 residents. But the Atlantic bubble, which would have required her to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, made it “impossible” to attend in-person showings. Instead, she relied on a local real estate agent she had come to trust.

Wright took possession of the house, which she purchased for $250,000, in January. Over the August long weekend, she and her puppy made the move to her four-bedroom, 2,400 square-foot century home on a corner lot.

There seems to be a marked increase in the number of people, like Wright, who are purchasing homes sight unseen. Observers say it’s a sign of how heated the housing market became over the course of the pandemic and is a reflection of the home supply shortage.

But it’s difficult to quantify this phenomenon. The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) told Global News that it doesn’t track the circumstances around sales, including whether or not property is purchased sight unseen.

Matt Honsberger, the president of Royal LePage Atlantic, says there has a noticeable increase in this real estate trend during COVID-19. Pre-pandemic, 15 per cent of home buyers in Nova Scotia were from outside the province compared with 24 per cent this summer.

He says they’re “coming out here in droves over the last eight months,” which has forced agents to rely more heavily on virtual viewings, and new software which offers 360 degree views of homes. Honsberger says agents are also relying on FaceTime to tour prospective buyers.

‘Not as crazy as it seems’

There is, however, anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon beyond Atlantic Canada, from people with years of experience in the industry.

RE/MAX sales representative Tanya Hyatt, who is based in Kingston, Ont. has been selling homes for 15 years. She told Global News that pre-pandemic she’s sold property sight unseen “once or twice” over the span of her career, but she’s had four clients make such purchases this year alone.

“Multimedia, 3-D tours, video and floor plans do make it easier to shop online for what is often one’s biggest purchase,” Hyatt says.

John Pasalis, president of Toronto real estate brokerage Realosophy Realty, points to what’s happened in the housing market during the pandemic to push up home prices and fuel the pandemic buying frenzy: historically low mortgage rates, a desire for more space, unprecedented household savings rates.

“It’s completely understandable that this is happening,” he told Global News about the increase in purchases sight unseen. “Quite frankly, it’s not as crazy as it seems. People buy homes pre-construction based on plans. It’s not like they physically see the home.”

Tina Hennigar is the population coordinator for Lunenberg, N.S. As someone who actively recruits people to relocate to the port town, she says it boils down to supply, or lack of it.

“Like the rest of Canada, we’ve had some housing shortages,” she told Global News. “So we talked to our municipal governments during the last municipal election and the provincial government to say ‘this is really an issue that needs all of our attention.’”

Enlisting help

Becky and Terry Irvine are currently settling into their new home, purchased sight unseen, in Belledune, N.B.

The house itself, at 700 square feet, is smaller than the 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bathroom home they sold in Lindsay, Ont. But the backyard is about “six times” larger, according to Becky, with “800 or so acres of bush, ocean and fields around us.”

The couple craved more outdoor space and the price tag on their new home, which they say was $100,000 including all fees, or roughly one-fifth of what their previous place fetched.

The Irvines say their retirement plan has long been a return to New Brunswick, where Terry grew up. Pandemic lockdowns and restrictions have accelerated their planned move.

“Because of COVID, we’re not living the life that we want to so we’re going now, so we can actually enjoy ourselves,” Becky said.

Before making the purchase, the couple enlisted help from family members who live in the area.

“I asked my aunt and uncle to go look at the house for us,” says Terry. “My uncle’s a carpenter and I trust his opinion 100 per cent. He looked at it and said ‘yeah, it’s a no-brainer.’”

Wright, on the other hand, wasn’t able to have that kind of help and she discovered a lot of things that need work. By her estimates, fixing the place up to her liking will cost about $100,000.

“I did have it inspected and the report said it’s got good bones and standing reasonably straight for a 100-year-old house,” she said. “What didn’t come up in the inspection was the fact that the front porch was, in my contractor’s words, ‘a safety hazard.’”

“It was a pretty big project,” she says.

Another surprise came when Wright saw the backyard in person for the first time, and not through a wide-angle camera lens.

“My biggest disappointment or disconnect with what I thought was the backyard” she says. “The backyard is smaller than I thought. It’s a gravel pit.”

Salmaan Farooqui,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017,"In any normal winter, Cameron Birch and his family of five would pack their bags for an all-inclusive vacation somewhere warm and sunny.

But when the pandemic kept them from booking a trip south, the Kelowna, B.C., family looked closer to home and bought season passes to Big White Ski Resort for the first time.

“Last year was a little bit of a trial. Did we know if we were going to utilize it? Not really,” said Birch, who took the plunge and spent around $2,500 on season passes for his wife and three children aged between eight and 12.

It ended up being a hit, with the family getting around 25 days on the hill, sometimes just to spend a couple of hours of the day outside. Now, Birch expects to buy a pass every year, and says many of his friends in the community will do the same.

Story continues below advertisement

Strength in season pass sales has been one bright spot in an otherwise difficult year for Western Canada’s big mountain resorts as travel restrictions and other pandemic-related measures caused a plunge in high-spending destination skiers.

Michael Ballingall, senior vice-president of Big White, said last winter was one of their best ever for season passes, even as individual ticket sales dropped by roughly 80 per cent.

He said many residents took a chance on the resort because it was one of the few activities that would almost definitely be available during the pandemic.

“People knew the mountain was going to open, and they put down on the early bird season pass, so they at least had something they knew they’d be able to do,” said Balingall, who said new skiers gave it a try, and lapsed skiers rediscovered an old love.

The other thing is you had lapsed skiers and snowboarders who remembered the thrill of sliding, and we think that’s caused a rebirth.“

The surge in interest last winter could point to a strong long-term outlook, but experts in the industry say it also did little to help what was a disastrous year for ski resorts in the short-term financial picture.

Season-pass sales create much less revenue per visit than a single-day ticket purchased by a tourist. And the Canada West Ski Areas Association says international tourists will often spend four or five times as much money while at the resort compared with locals.

0:59 Photo-finish win for B.C. skier in Red Bull race Photo-finish win for B.C. skier in Red Bull race – Mar 27, 2021

Industry experts say international visitors are the ones who buy tour packages, ski rentals and lessons, top-shelf liquor, fancy meals and all the other things that keep the resort and local economy churning.

Story continues below advertisement

More often, Canadian consumers are the ones coming to a resort with a car full of groceries and some existing knowledge of the sport and surrounding area.

“What we’re seeing so far is that season-pass sales may be strong, and for some areas that may be a good thing, but in other areas it completely masks the significant net loss in revenue overall,” said Christopher Nicolson, president & CEO of the CWSAA.

He said resorts near cities like Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton have more to gain from strong season pass sales, as their business model already depend less on international tourists and they have a larger population to draw from.

But smaller communities will continue to struggle until ticket sales from international visitors pick up again.

Nicolson doesn’t expect that to happen immediately. He believes it will take years before resorts return to pre-pandemic visitation levels.

Robyn Mitz, a program co-ordinator and instructor for Selkirk College’s ski operations course in Nelson, B.C., said some smaller resorts will look at new ticketing models to raise revenues in the interim.

One strategy for resorts that Mitz pointed out is a 10-punch pass. It lets locals save on each day of skiing and benefit from flexibility, while allowing resorts to profit more off of return visitors.

She said strong retail sales for ski and snowboard equipment last year are also confidence inspiring for strong demand from local markets in year to come. While skis were not as difficult to find as bikes in 2020, many products sold out quicker than usual.

Back in Kelowna, Ballingall said one of the big positives from strong season pass sales is a sense of confidence for resorts going into the ski season.

He said resorts often base their expectations for the season _ and their ability to hire and prepare operations _ on cash flow generated from pass sales in off-season months.

“The business survives off lift ticket sales and maintains itself on season pass sales,” said Ballingall.

“The day that you open you’ve got to staff everything and groom the runs, and if your season pass sales can cover those costs, then your day ticket sales are going to be what’s able to keep you going.”

For skiers like Birch, a father in a family of five, the season pass represents a sense of community.

When indoor gatherings were banned last year, he said the ski resort was the place where friends could spend time together, whether it was playing in the snow or making s’mores in the parking lot.

“I know who walks through the door in this community. I know who is vaccinated and who is not vaccinated, and that makes it harder,” said owner Cassie Rowse.

“You can’t win. One of the reasons I haven’t announced anything is I know the minute I do, that’s when we will start getting the threats and the bullying and ‘Why are you doing this? Why are you being a sheep? Why are you not standing up to the government?'”

The owners of the British Teahouse in High River chose to close indoor dining two weeks ago rather than opt into the vaccine passport system, but their revenue dropped sharply when they were limited to takeout, so the owners said they will opt into the province’s restrictions exemption program — also known as a vaccine passport — later this week.

“We didn’t feel it was our responsibility as a brand new small business to pick and choose who came into our establishment to eat,” said owner Rebecca Mason.

“We had a lot of support from people who didn’t support the program, but that on its own isn’t keeping our business going. We have to make a choice between losing our business and doing something that we believe in.”

"Nathalie Sturgeon, Rebecca Lau",Global News,11/28/2017," 

New Brunswick is capping off a record-breaking weekend with 93 new cases of COVID-19 reported on Sunday.

As well, two more New Brunswickers have died as a result of the virus.

The deaths include a person in their 70s in Zone 2 (Saint John region) and a person in their 50s in Zone 4 (Edmundston region). This brings the province’s total number of deaths to 66.

Saturday’s case count was 140 with four deaths. With 96 new recoveries, the active case count is 759.

Case breakdown:

10 new cases in Zone 1 (Moncton region)

5 new cases in Zone 2 (Saint John region)

29 new cases in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)

29 new cases in Zone 4 (Edmundston region)

6 new cases in Zone 5 (Campbellton region)

“One of the reasons it looks so much worse than it is or looks as bad as it does is because we were so well managed for the 17 months of this,” data analyst Ray Harris tells Global News.

“So if you compare these numbers to what we’ve experienced, it is really bad.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""So if you compare these numbers to what we've experienced, it is really bad.""

Harris thinks things will get worse before it gets better and, in theory, it should become clear soon whether the province’s return to masking and the introduction of proof-of-vaccination worked.

There are now 45 people in hospital, including 20 in an intensive care unit.

Of those currently in hospital, 35 are unvaccinated, 10 are either partially vaccinated or fully vaccinated.

Testing backlog mostly ‘resolved’

Epidemiologist Kevin Wilson says a high testing capacity is key to riding out the fourth wave.

“Obviously you don’t want to see record-breaking case or mortality rates or hospitalizations or ICU occupancy rates,” he says.

“It’s just the natural progression of what’s been building for the last couple of weeks and that’s why you’re seeing the New Brunswick government and Public Health ramp up pushing vaccines more aggressively, ramping up testing capacity.”

2:05 Frustration growing among people waiting for COVID-19 test Frustration growing among people waiting for COVID-19 test

Both Harris and Wilson say the backlog of testing is concerning and is likely playing a role in the case counts. There have been reports of seven-day waits for a testing appointment.

 

Harris says some people may even avoid getting tested because of the wait, leaving a lot of uncertainty around the true severity of caseloads.

For their part, the province says delays in testing at assessment centres throughout the province have been resolved “in all areas except for Zone 3 (Fredericton region).”

It’s expected that the backlog will be “resolved” before the end of the day Tuesday. Elsewhere, appointments are being booked between 24 and 48 hours, according to the province.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, tells Global News that those looking for a test are being triaged. Those with symptoms go first. Next comes close contacts and then people with no close contacts or potential symptoms.

She says those people who aren’t at the first of the line will wait a bit longer.

Vaccination rates and public gatherings

Currently, 80.5 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated, and 89.5 per cent have received their first dose of a vaccine.

Of Sunday’s new cases, Public Health says 67 per cent involved people who were unvaccinated, 13 per cent were partially vaccinated and 20 per cent were fully vaccinated.

Russell says the province is concerned by the numbers but especially by what contact tracing has revealed to Public Health.

 

She says it shows that the virus is spreading through private gatherings, including hunting parties, birthday parties, private funerals and a backyard wedding.

“We really need people to stick to their steady 20,” she says. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We really need people to stick to their steady 20,"" she says.

Late last month, Health Minister Dorothy Shephard met with several faith-based organizations to work with them on ensuring a 90 per cent vaccination rate among their members.

The 90 per cent figure is the number Premier Blaine Higgs identified as the province’s new target for full vaccinations, and he said he expects faith organizations to adhere to New Brunswick’s proof-of-vaccine policy.

The province has had public safety officers out this weekend conducting spot checks at churches “to ensure the mandatory order rules are being followed.” The province says that’s because a number of churches have been the site of public exposures recently.

 

“Early reports from officers conducting the checks show compliance has been good,” the province notes.

“Our phones were ringing off the hook before the start of this semester,” she said. “We are fully enrolled in all of our certificates and both of the diplomas are very well attended as well. So the students are really looking for the hands-on and intensive experience that is offered at this school.”

The campus, nestled in cottage country in Haliburton, Ont., is home to programs like digital image design, artist blacksmith, fibre arts and ceramics.

René Petitjean is an instructor for both artist blacksmith and ceramics. He said he has noticed a boom in both disciplines.

“Especially with clay,” he said. “In talking to our supplier, they have sold more kilns than ever before. And they are selling smaller kilns because people are doing it at home because of COVID.”

Petitjean said he thinks people are looking for that hands-on connection and said creative activities like pottery can help with stress and anxiety.

“It is very calming,” said Petitjean. “You can think of it kind of like a yoga practice, it is all fluid.”

He said the class has become so popular this year, they are adding a winter term in both ceramics and artist blacksmith.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the suit claiming the studio breached its contract with the actor by releasing Black Widow on its Disney+ streaming service instead of in theatres has been settled, with terms of the deal “not disclosed.”

Johansson’s suit sent shockwaves through Hollywood; it claimed that releasing the film through Disney+ brought additional revenue to the new streaming service while saving millions in back-end bonuses based on box-office performance, and would likely have been paid to Johansson had the film been released in theatres as originally planned.

“There was just such a wealth of talent of wonderful poets here in Vernon that we wanted to, first of all, find out why that’s really why we started, was why this small city has given us so many great writers and specifically poets,” said Curtis Emde, co-director and producer at The Orange Lamphouse Studio.

The upcoming documentary titled Why We Write follows a dozen poets and explores their passion for words.

“I write because I can’t help it, it just occurs to me when I’m standing at a gas station or sitting down in a coffee shop,” said Lent.

The poetry shares different perspectives on the natural world, one of the many muses that poet Michelle Doege finds herself returning to.

“Honestly, [poetry] keeps me alive and well and it is a form of nourishment. I need to eat, yes but, I need to live in the world in a deeper space that has time to connect with things on a different level,” said Doege.

Of course, the documentary isn’t short on poems.

“I think poetry allows us to think about things we might not normally think about, to see things that we might not normally see. So, when we read a poem, we can all relate to it … and the feelings that the poet is having,” said Hannah Calder, co-director and producer of the documentary.

“At three, four or five years old, when the hormone level is high, they will go up the creek that they were born to almost exactly the spot that they were from,” said Marnie Vanstone, RDCO Park interpreter.

This year, more than 4,000 Kokanee Salmon have been counted at Hardy Falls alone. Interpreters are on hand at Hardy Falls Regional Park as well as at Mission Creek Regional Park in Kelowna to help families discover the importance of fall spawning and the life cycle of the Kokanee Salmon.

The returning salmon lay their eggs in nests in the gravel, as many as 1,000 at a time for the males to fertilize. Though for the Kokanee Salmon, life is full of dangers from the very beginning.

“The eggs are high in protein, so even the bears go for the eggs and from there they proceed to get the rest of what they want, but even the ducks will eat the bodies,” said Vanstone.

Canada’s first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation will be held on Thursday.

The federal statutory holiday is intended to give people a chance to pause and reflect on the legacy of the residential school system on Canada’s Indigenous Peoples.

In Ottawa, institutions and Indigenous groups are hosting a number of events to commemorate the day, to remember lives lost through the residential schools and to provide opportunities to learn the truth about Canada’s relationship with First Nations, Métis and Inuit people.

While public sector employees and workers in federally regulated industries such as banks will have the day off, Ontario did not move to make the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation a provincial holiday.

 

As such, many businesses will remain open on Thursday, though some might have adjusted hours.

During the inaugural National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, Calgary’s outgoing mayor, Naheed Nenshi, offered some advice.

“Read White Goose Flying.”

Those comments come five years after the White Goose Flying report was originally published.

Marilyn North Peigan, a Blackfoot woman and member of the Piikani nation, was part of the committee tasked with producing the report.

Work on the White Goose Flying report was ultimately a healing process for her.

“I came as an intergenerational person sitting at that table, because my grandparents on both sides were at the residential schools and my family is part of the sixties scoop,” North Peigan told Global News. “And I myself went to a federal Indian state school.”

 

Named for a 17-year-old Piikani Nation teen who attended St. Dunstan’s industrial school in Ogden and died of tuberculosis in 1899, the White Goose Flying report took the 94 calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and determined which would be most appropriate for the city to act upon.

Advice from an elder on how her actions as part of the Calgary Aboriginal Urban Affairs Committee (CAUAC) could affect the community helped her focus.

 

“It was going to be for the betterment of all Calgarians and not just one specific group of people, because I am a Canadian Forces veteran and I gave that oath to represent everybody underneath that flag with full honor.”

CAUAC produced the report in May 2016, a year after the TRC concluded its work.

“I went through a period of healing once we tabled that report because I had to deal with all that information and it was my story in those books.”

Five years on, the city has acted on some of the 43 calls to action in the local report, including displaying the Treaty 7 First Nations flags at municipal plaza and in council chambers, renaming Reconciliation Bridge, land acknowledgements and the creation of the Indigenous relations office.

 

North Peigan expressed frustration over how few of those calls to action have been acted upon since the White Goose Flying report was presented to city leaders.

The death of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests across the country and in Calgary, the racism hearings at city hall, a commitment to anti-racism from city council and City of Calgary senior management was almost a déja vu for North Peigan.

“One of the largest issues that I had to agree with when the Black Lives Matters came to the forefront last summer was the fact that Canada was offering as a solution symbolism and not action,” the former CAUAC member said. “And that’s exactly the situation we are in when it comes to the White Goose Flying report.“

A member of the Calgary Police Commission, North Peigan understands the pace at which institutions change.

 

“I have to have patience because, being on the police commission, one thing I know about public change is that you have to have patience and it takes time,” she said. “This is why we say it’s going to take generations to change.”

’Indigenous 101’

One agent of change is the city’s Indigenous relations office, which opened in January 2020.

And this year, it rolled out an education program for all 15,000 City of Calgary employees, called “Indigenous 101.”

“It provided the history of Indigenous people, pre-contact history, the history of colonization and the developments of of the modern era in terms of the actions that have taken place to restore the rights of Indigenous people and the decolonization efforts that are underway,” Dr. Terry Poucette, team lead for the city’s Indigenous relations office, said.

That matches TRC call to action number 57: “to provide education to public servants on the history of Aboriginal peoples, including the history and legacy of residential schools, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Treaties and Aboriginal rights, Indigenous law, and Aboriginal–Crown relations.”

Poucette said the Indigenous relations office is also able to tailor training to needs of individual business units within the city and that senior city management was “very supportive” of the webinar.

 

At a June 8 meeting of the city’s priorities and finance committee, Poucette said she would like to see the city develop a suite of Indigenous relations curriculum.

That meeting also revealed cuts to the budget of the Indigenous relations office, from $1.1 million to $618,000.

Making a monument

The discovery of unmarked graves at former Indian residential school sites across the country, starting in May 2021, spurred Calgarians to create an impromptu monument of childrens’ shoes and other items on the steps of city hall, one of many that would span the country.

That seemed to be the impetus the city needed to enact call to action number 82: establishing a monument recognizing the history of residential schools.

According to the National Center for Truth and Reconciliation, five of Alberta’s 25 residential schools were near Calgary.

“In August, the City of Calgary and the indigenous community had a pipe ceremony where we committed to work together to establish a more permanent memorial to honor Indian residential school children that died there, as well as survivors,” Poucette said.

A working group that includes members of the Indigenous community is in the early phases of determining what that permanent memorial could look like. That could include some of the memorial display from the steps of city hall.

 

Another call to action that is now underway is establishing an Indigenous gathering place, reflecting TRC call to action number 21: “healing centres to address the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual harms caused by residential schools.”

That work began with another pipe ceremony and memorandum of understanding with the Indigenous Gathering Place Society in June.

Housing as reconciliation

And the city is looking at how it can help fill in the gaps of affordable housing for Indigenous people in Calgary.

“What was unique about this project was that a governance model was created that honors Indigenous and non-Indigenous approaches to engagement,” Poucette, a Stoney-Nakoda woman, said.

“It paralleled Indigenous processes and worldviews in the engagement strategy and created an ethical space for the city and the Indigenous nations to work collaboratively together.”

Poucette said part of Calgary Housing Company’s future role could include the co-creation of an Indigenous urban housing strategy.

“If this urban Indigenous housing strategy becomes a reality, I think that it would move the reconciliation needle substantially,” she said, “because many people that are homeless in the city are Indigenous people and they’re homeless for a variety of reasons, including barriers that would allow them to obtain housing.”

 

Katie Black, general manager of community services, recognized that there is still work to be done to realize the rest of the 43 calls to action highlighted in the White Goose Flying report.

“As much as we have started, we are very mindful of how very, very much work is ahead of us at the city, to demonstrate that we take our responsibility to heart.”

Reconciliation as election issue

“I believe that the city’s commitment to truth and reconciliation will continue regardless of elections now or in the future, and the Indigenous Relations Office will participate in the orientation of the new council,” Poucette said.

Calgarians go to the polls to select a new mayor and council on Oct. 18.

“We look forward to meeting with the new mayor and council and working with them on the next steps in the advancement of the truth and reconciliation work that needs to be done,” she added.

At a recent mayoral forum hosted by the University of Calgary Students’ Union, candidates were asked for their thoughts on reconciliation in the city.

 

“Many of the calls are symbolic in nature,” Jeromy Farkas said, pointing to displaying Treaty 7 flags in the council chamber.

Farkas said he planned to continue advocacy for issues like crime and safety, development and access to clean water for the neighbouring Tsuut’ina Nation, “seeking that opportunity, that potential to live out a great Canadian life.”

In addition to displaying Treaty 7 flags, Jyoti Gondek said the White Goose Flying report instructed council to establish a Indigenous gathering space and acknowledging the history of residential schools.

“The next steps that we have been advised to take by our Indigenous relations office is to carry on with public education, to challenge any curriculum that doesn’t include truth and reconciliation, to provide affordable housing and homelessness prevention solutions and here’s the big one: to have a budget for the Indigenous Relations Office that doesn’t keep getting slashed.”

Gondek proposed a perpetual funding stream for the Indigenous relations office.

“It’s one thing to do a land acknowledgment; it’s entirely another to dedicate funding from any land sales that the city has over time to go directly towards the Indigenous Relations Office.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""It's one thing to do a land acknowledgment; it's entirely another to dedicate funding from any land sales that the city has over time to go directly towards the Indigenous Relations Office.""

Zak Hartley wanted to hear from area First Nations to get a list of priorities from them, akin to the TRC or the White Goose Flying report.

 

Teddy Ogbonna called for a commission to hear from Treaty 7 nations.

Brad Field said “we have to get comfortable with uncomfortable conversations.”

Other candidates for mayor and council took to social media on Thursday to post their stances on reconciliation.

Running to be councillor for Ward 7, North Peigan sees October’s election to be pivotal in the path towards reconciliation.

“This is going to be an election for the generations to come, definitely, but this is also the opportunity for Calgarians to form a new relationship with their city,” she said, adding that reconciliation should be part of the city’s recovery plans.

“I’m hopeful today because we are strong and we are resilient. The most resilient people on this land are our people.”

Speaking at the ceremony, outgoing Mayor Naheed Nenshi encouraged Calgarians to read the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report, to identify ways they can “make those actions real in your own lives.”

“From supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs, to ensuring that we are always supporting organizations that are doing the good work of healing that trauma,” he said.

Jacob Lane had never sewn before, but in the days leading up to Sept. 30 — the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation — the 13 year old was hand-stitching miniature orange moccasins.

The moccasins are a tribute to those who were in residential schools.

Lane, a Métis student in Grade 8 at Kitchener Community School in Regina, Sask., knows Indigenous students were torn from their families and sent away to church-run schools.

“I don’t really talk about it at home,” said Lane, “but me and my family know it was real bad.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""I don't really talk about it at home,"" said Lane, ""but me and my family know it was real bad.""

The teachings in his classroom go far beyond Orange Shirt Day.

 

Jessica Madiratta, an Indigenous advocate teacher at the school, said the majority of students attending are Indigenous — they are immersed in the history and culture year-round.

“With having Indigenous studies every day, it’s just something that’s just a part of their everyday classroom experience,” said Madiratta.

The discussions are age-appropriate, but Madiratta said the most important thing for all students to learn is truth.

Etienna Moostoos-Lafferty, and Indigenous education coach, has also been sharing that same message in schools and on social media.

Moostoos-Lafferty, from Edmonton, Alta., has been working with an Evergreen Catholic School to develop resources for teachers.

She calls it “10 Days of Truth THEN Reconciliation.”

“I really wanted to make sure it wasn’t just ‘truth and reconciliation,'” said Moostoos-Lafferty. “We sometimes just throw that term around so loosely and to many Indigenous people, myself included, my grandma was a survivor of residential school.”

Moostoos-Lafferty said she is honoured and “blown away” that educators across the country have been sharing her resource.

Her guide suggested age-appropriate discussions and activities leading up to Sept. 30.

She shared letters from students in Spruce Grove, Alta., who wrote to her about her bravery.

“It wasn’t to apologize or feel bad or feel guilt,” said Moostoos-Lafferty, “it was just to respond, talk about how that made you feel, talk about how her story made you feel.”

It’s a heavy topic, one Moostoos-Lafferty said some teachers and parents are nervous to approach.

She often hears: “I don’t want to traumatize them. I don’t want them to be worried.”

But there are ways to go about it gently, said Moostoos-Lafferty and Madiratta.

They both recommend reading books about residential schools to children.

Despite staying in the fight until the very end, the Winnipeg Jets couldn’t muster enough offence to put away the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday night.

The Canucks opened the scoring with a goal from Bo Horvat. The home team added tallies from Nic Petan and Tanner Pearson, escaping with a 3-2 victory.

Jeff Mallot and Kristian Reichel scored for Winnipeg.

Vancouver badly outshot the Jets 33-18.

Both starting goalies made their pre-season debuts tonight with Winnipeg’s Mikael Berdin, allowing three goals on 33 shots.

Vancouver’s Jaroslav Halak allowed one goal on 10 shots in his first game as a member of the Canucks. Halak was replaced after the second period.

 

It was a shaky start to the evening for Berdin as the 23-year-old Russian goaltender couldn’t stop Vancouver’s first shot on goal courtesy of captain Bo Horvat.

Berdin played the puck from behind his own net to the near corner where Tanner Pearson was waiting to feed Horvat in front.

The captain ripped a one-timer off the pad of Berdin and watched it slowly trickle across the goal line. 1-0 Canucks just 3:32 into the game.

Winnipeg found an equalizer just after the midway mark of the period off the stick of Jeff Mallot.

Leon Gawanke’s point shot bounced around for what seemed like forever before Mallot fired home his first point of the pre-season.

Vancouver held the edge in first period shots, outshooting the visitors 9-5 after twenty minutes of play.

 

Less than three minutes into the middle frame, a scrum erupted in front of Berdin after a Connor Garland wrister was covered up.

Garland got himself into a shoving match with Jansen Harkins that saw both players penalized for roughing.

On the ensuing 4-on-4, Vancouver defenceman Madison Bowey fed Nic Petan in the slot and Jets’ 2013 second round pick lasered one over the shoulder of Berdin to the give the Canucks their second lead of the game.

Canucks’ head coach Travis Green elected to pull Jaroslav Halak from the game with a 2-1 lead after 40 minutes.

Halak gave way to Vancouver’s 2017 third round pick Michael Dipietro.

He immediately received some run support after Johnathan Kovacevic coughed up the puck to Bo Horvat on the forecheck.

 

Horvat left a drop pass for Nils Hoglander before the puck ended up on the tape of Tanner Pearson. 3-1 Canucks.

The Jets made things interesting with just 3:16 left in the game.

Kristian Reichel jumped on the puck immediately after a David Gustafsson face-off win and wired a wrister over Dipietro’s glove.

Despite climbing within a goal near the end of the final frame, the Jets couldn’t muster a third tally.

Dipietro made seven saves in 20 minutes of action as the Canucks improved their pre season record to 2-2.

Winnipeg returns home to the Canada Life Centre for a tilt with the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night.

They’ll wrap up exhibition play on Friday in Calgary.

The Edmonton Elks returned to the field on Sunday as they held a short walkthrough at Commonwealth Stadium.

The Elks last played on Tuesday in Ottawa losing 34-24 to the Redblacks, the Elks’ third straight loss to see a 2-2 record after Labour Day now falls to 2-5 and last place in the Western Division and last overall in the CFL.

One boost the Elks will receive on Friday in Winnipeg is the apparent return of quarterback Trevor Harris, who led the first team offence in Sunday’s short practice session.

Will Harris start against the 7-1 Winnipeg Blue Bombers on Friday night? Head coach Jamie Elizondo gave a strong lean towards the affirmative when asked if his number one quarterback is healthy enough.

“Yes, he is, “Elizondo said. “And that’s a plus.”

Harris has missed the last two games after suffering a neck injury during the Labour Day rematch game against the Calgary Stampeders. He was placed on the team’s six-game injured list two days before the Elks faced the Bombers at home on Sept. 18.

Harris was pulled off the six-game list on Sept. 25 but was a healthy scratch in the Elks’ loss to the Redblacks as backup Taylor Cornelius started his second straight game.

Harris has his sights set on a return this Friday in Winnipeg.

“I hope so, but that’s always up to the coaches., so I’ll do my part, do what I can to be available and get ready to rock,” he said.

“I’ve been healthy. I felt good last week, and I feel better this week, so I feel ready to rock, to get the second half of the season going and go on this run.”

Harris is currently fifth in the CFL in passing with 1,481 yards. He’s thrown for six touchdown passes and five interceptions.

 

The task of making the post-season will be a daunting one for the Elks, who, in their last seven games, face the Bombers twice, the Saskatchewan Roughriders twice, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the Toronto Argonauts and the B.C. Lions.

Their final three games will be played over seven days.

Edmonton Oilers forward Josh Archibald has been diagnosed with myocarditis and is out indefinitely.

Archibald, who turns 29 on Oct. 6, had yet to take part in a practice with his teammates at training camp after coming out of quarantine. Oilers head coach Dave Tippett indicated last week that Archibald had been skating on his own and wasn’t feeling up to speed.

“When he came up from the States, he had to quarantine for 14 days. The back half of that 14 days, he wasn’t feeling well. He had a severe viral infection coming out of his quarantine. He tried to skate for a few days and just wasn’t feeling right,” explained Tippett.

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle.

Oilers goalie Alex Stalock is likely to miss the entire season after being diagnosed with myocarditis. Stalock texted positive for COVID-19 last November.

Former Oilers forward Mark Letestu missed the majority of the 2019-20 season with myocarditis while playing for the Winnipeg Jets.

Archibald, who Oilers general manager Ken Holland identifies as the only unvaccinated member of the team, will undergo further tests this week.

“He’s having a CAT scan, he’s having an MRI this week just to figure out where we are,” said Tippett.

Archibald spent the last two seasons of his six-year NHL career with the Oilers. Tippett said Archibald has been missed in the dressing room during camp.

“He’s a popular guy in there. He’s one of those heart-and-soul guy players. He hasn’t felt well since he got back, so guys are concerned about him,” said Tippett.

On Sunday, the Oilers assigned defencemen Philip Broberg and Filip Berglund and goalie Ilya Konovalov to Bakersfield of the AHL. Forward Cooper Marody and Seth Griffith were placed on waivers.

Bill Graveland,The Canadian Press,11/28/2017," 

The interim leader of the fledgling Maverick Party says it will be making some key changes after a disappointing result in last month’s federal election.

Formerly known as Wexit Canada, the party advocates for the independence of Western Canada or constitutional changes that would benefit the West. It ran 29 candidates in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Manitoba.

It pulled in 1.4 per cent of the vote in Saskatchewan and 1.3 per cent in Alberta but barely raised the needle in B.C., where it picked up 0.1 per cent.

“Things could have turned out better. I’m not going to try and B.S. you,” said interim leader Jay Hill in a recent interview with The Canadian Press.

 

“There were a number of factors that really produced the results that we saw, the really disappointing results. It is what it is.”

Hill was elected in 1993 for the Reform Party of Canada in the Prince George-Peace River riding in British Columbia and had a long political career as Reform morphed into the Canadian Alliance and ultimately the Conservative Party of Canada. He served as government house leader under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Hill said some of the problems the Mavericks encountered were that few people had heard of the party when the election was called, there was a surging fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and voters were concerned about vote-splitting and giving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau another mandate.

“The vast majority of Prairie westerners held their noses and voted for Erin O’Toole, even though they now know he’s a Liberal in a Conservative blue suit,” Hill said.

 

Hill acknowledged that Wexit Canada’s initial focus on western separation probably hurt the Mavericks as well, and, in hindsight, they should have built a new party from scratch.

“It was totally devoted to Alberta separatism, not even western separatism, but Alberta separatism and that left a certain degree of discomfort with most westerners who aren’t prepared at this point to go that far.”

At a news conference the day after the federal election, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who worked alongside Hill in the Harper government, pointed to the lack of support the Maverick Party received.

“I would note the de facto western separatist party, the Maverick Party, got only about one per cent of the vote in Alberta and they couldn’t even field a full slate of candidates,” Kenney said.

“That probably understates support for separation in this province significantly, but it is a signal. The majority of Albertans went out and voted in a federal election and … one per cent voted for a separatist party.”

Hill said lessons have been learned. He expects a new permanent party leader will be in place next year and the Mavericks will be aiming to field candidates in all western ridings when the next election is called.

“We’re going to totally ignore the whole vote-splitting thing and do like Reform did: basically run everywhere we can get organized. Only unlike Reform, it will only be in the west.”

Lori Williams, a political scientist at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, said the results were not a huge surprise, since most people had no idea who the Maverick Party was, it had an interim leader and it was facing a higher-profile, national campaign from the People’s Party of Canada.

“Maxime Bernier was generating support from both the kinds of people who would otherwise support Maverick as well as the anti-vax crowd,” Williams said.

“Canadians were more aware of (the People’s Party) as an alternative than other parties that are out there.”

 

With a new leader and some national attention, the Maverick Party could generate more support next time, Williams suggested.

That could hurt the federal Conservatives, she said.

“There are a lot of people … for whom winning government is not as important as standing on principle and those people aren’t going to stick with the Conservative Party.”"

Two prominent doctors have signed their names to a letter addressed to Albertans calling on them to demand that the provincial government release its latest COVID-19 modelling that is guiding its pandemic-related decisions.

In a letter dated Oct. 1, Alberta’s former chief medical officer of health Dr. James Talbot and Dr. Noel Gibney, professor emeritus at the University of Alberta’s department of critical care medicine, wrote that they “would like to know how long the fourth wave is going to last, how many more Albertans are projected to die and when we can expect elective surgeries to begin and ICUs to return to normal.”

The doctors cite Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey saying that earlier this week that Premier Jason Kenney told him his province’s help was not needed because Alberta’s predictive modelling suggests the additional resources aren’t needed at this time. On Thursday, Kenney announced he had accepted help from Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as from the federal government.

 

“Our health-care system is in crisis, ICU capacity is under killing pressure and the acute health-care workforce is spiritually, physically and mentally bone-weary,” Talbot and Gibney wrote.

While Kenney said Thursday that his government is not considering additional health measures until it has a better sense of how effective measures brought in earlier this month have been at reducing COVID-19’s spread and hospitalizations, Talbot and Gibney’s letter reiterates suggestions they have made which they believe could help address “the astonishingly high COVID rates in our province.”

The recommendations include the “reinstitution of contact tracing and limited measures to prevent indoor transmission.”

“The premier has called our last recommendation a lockdown and further says he refuses to do anything that will punish the fully immunized,” the letter reads.

“Our call for limited restrictions to prevent indoor transmission are, at most, an inconvenience for the fully vaccinated who are, in fact, being punished now by a government whose continued inaction is depriving them of planned surgery, access to hospital beds and properly functioning ICUs.”

The health minister’s press secretary Steve Buick said the government is watching AHS’s “early warning system”, an internal capacity-planning tool updated constantly based on the latest trends.

 

He said it shows a wide range of potential scenarios at a given time, “ranging from a potential drop in admissions (if we’re at or near the peak in cases), to a potential increase”.

“The worst case informs contingency planning, but as the premier said we are working to ensure it does not happen, including the public health measures announced about 2 weeks ago,” Buick said.

“We continue to watch the data and the impact of recent changes and will take further action if and as warranted, including most recently the implementation of mandatory vaccination for the public service.”

Buick was pressed about releasing that data, but has not replied.

Talbot and Gibney also suggest they believe the government appears to be trying to allow COVID-19 to spread throughout the province in an attempt to achieve herd immunity.

“It is clear from the actions of the government of Alberta and the premier that their callous strategy is to stand by until enough Albertans have contracted COVID, become ill and then, hopefully, recovered, to get to the point where there are too few Albertans without immunity for the COVID virus to find new victims,” the letter reads. “Such a strategy will continue to cost us at least 20 unimmunized Albertan lives a day, create maximum stress for the health-care system and health-care workers and deprive thousands of Albertans of planned surgeries and other potentially life-saving treatments.

 

READ MORE: COVID-19: Saskatchewan woman who was scared after Alberta surgery cancelled says it’s back on

“Key to understanding this cold-blooded strategy is determining how long it will take to achieve this goal of ‘herd immunity.’ Knowing that tells us how many more Albertans will die from COVID or from being deprived of access to the health-care system and how long AHS (Alberta Health Services) and its employees must endure this killing stress.

“We believe Albertans should demand to see the data, the assumptions and the modelling used to make the decision to continue to do nothing.”

On Friday, Alberta Health announced 14 more deaths attributed to COVID-19 and that 1,630 additional cases of COVID-19 had been identified in the province in the past 24 hours.

In an email to Global News on Friday, AHS spokesperson Kerry Williamson said the health authority “continues to do all it can to ensure we have enough ICU capacity to meet patient demand, including opening additional spaces and redeploying staff.”

As of 12:15 p.m. on Friday, Williamson said Alberta had 374 ICU beds open, noting that number is because the province has worked to expand capacity to accommodate the surge in patients. Its normal baseline capacity is 173 ICU beds.

 

“There are currently 316 patients in ICU, the vast majority of whom are COVID positive,” Williamson said. “The number of patients in ICU has increased by five per cent in the past seven days.

“Provincially, ICU capacity (including additional surge beds) is currently at 84 per cent. Without the additional surge spaces, provincial ICU capacity would be at 183 per cent.”"
Eric Stober,Global News,11/28/2017," 

Canada’s health-care capacity ranks among the worst of its peers and is a factor in economic losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a CIBC report.

The report, titled “Low hospital capacity in Canada: A continued economic risk as Covid becomes endemic,” highlights that Canada has one of the worst health-care capacities among developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

According to the Global Health Security Index, Canada ranks 41st out of 137 when it comes to capacity.

Canada’s capacity was already being strained prior to the pandemic in 2019 — and has caused Canada to implement more and stricter restrictions than other countries, resulting in less economic activity, according to the report.

 

COVID-19-related hospitalization per one million of the population in the U.S. and U.K. were four and five times higher than in Canada, respectively, but our system was still pushed to its limits during the second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, the report said.

“Simply put, we reached capacity at levels that many other countries consider to be acceptable,” the report states.

1:48 When will federal help arrive for Alberta’s struggling hospitals? When will federal help arrive for Alberta’s struggling hospitals?

“If we reach capacity faster than any other countries, that means that the trigger or the threshold to ignite [COVID-19] policies is much lower,” said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC and a co-author of the report. “This has major economic implications.”

Tal sees the pandemic as a “wake-up call” for Canada to invest in its health-care capacity to better handle COVID-19 as an endemic.

 

“We have to increase capacity, we have to make it a priority,” he said.

Canadian premiers have requested at least $28 billion in extra funding from the federal government, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he wouldn’t comment on extra funding until after the pandemic has ended.

Ontario, though, plans to spend almost all of its increases to health-care funding on new hospitals over the next 10 years, according to the report.

‘Thoughtful’ changes needed

Justin Hall, deputy chief of Sunnybrook Hospital’s Emergency Department in Toronto, agreed that capacity was definitely stretched to its limits even before the pandemic and that the worst may still be ahead given the great backlog of surgeries that hospitals will soon have to contend with, as well as a shortage of staff.

He said there has been an exodus of nurses during the pandemic due to the demands of the job.

“Our system right now is strained from a capacity perspective of humans,” Hall said.

However, Hall doesn’t think that money should just be thrown at the system, but that improvements have to be “thoughtful.”

 

“Money is a short-term solution to this, but I actually don’t think it’s the only thing that’s needed,” he said. “We really need a longer-term plan for how we’re going to address capacity on a long-term basis, not simply for the next year or two.”

That means taking a close look at hospitals’ needs a decade down the line and a significant investment in talent.

Hall also believes that there can be better coordination among provinces and different levels of government to “share lessons” instead of reinventing the wheel.

“We really have 14 different health systems that are operating in this country at various levels,” he said.

One challenge, though, is how geographically spread out the country is, which makes sharing resources or reaching northern communities difficult, but Hall said one silver lining of the pandemic is the rise of virtual care.

“Virtual care without a doubt is here to stay,” he said. “It’s very much an important part of how we’re going to address some of the capacity concerns as well.”"

The number of babies born in Canada fell to a nearly 15-year low last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but experts say that’s not the only factor leading to the decline.

Statistics Canada said 358,604 live births were reported across the country in 2020, the lowest number since 2006. The decline from 2019 — 3.6 per cent — was also the greatest-year-over-year decline in 14 years.

A decline was noted in every province and territory, the report noted further.

“It’s a consistent downward trend, and it’s consistent across most of the northern industrialized countries such as the U.S. and Australia,” said Mary-Ann Murphy, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia, who specializes in aging and demographics.

 

The Statistics Canada report, released Sept. 28, noted the United States saw a four per cent drop in births between 2019 and 2020, with decreases of 3.9 per cent and two per cent in the United Kingdom and France, respectively.

The number of births in Canada has been falling steadily over the past five years. There were over 383,000 births in 2016.

Murphy said the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be “the opposite of a baby boom,” with younger couples more concerned about job losses, finances and maintaining a roof over their heads than growing their families.

But she said the pandemic only magnified barriers to having children that she’s heard from her young students for years.

“I’ve got classrooms full of students who have paid for student loans and are getting close to completing degrees, and they will tell you that they have no intention of wasting those degrees,” she said.

 

Because of that, Murphy said, lots of women are spending what were once child-rearing years on advancing their careers and livelihoods — meaning many of those who do get pregnant don’t do so until their early 30s.

“And when you wait that late, you’re not going to end up having very many kids,” she said.

Meanwhile, traditional couples are choosing to not have children at all more than ever. As of 2016, just 51 per cent of couples were living with children, the lowest number on record. The number of childless couples has grown at a faster rate — just over seven per cent — than couples with children (2.3 per cent).

While that partially explains the years-long decline, Murphy said the pandemic has added additional roadblocks not just to starting a family, but to relationships altogether.

 

“People have been inside, the bars and clubs have been closed, and people have lost those traditional ways to meet people,” she said.

“At the same time, divorce lawyers have never been busier. So families were also breaking apart last year because they couldn’t stand being isolated together.”

According to Allison Venditti, founder of advocacy group Moms at Work, systemic societal problems that were already in place prior to the pandemic like the pay gap forced many women who had children or were planning to have them to either be “completely burnt out or laid off.”

“COVID sort of laid out very plainly for women where they sort of stood in society, especially mothers,” said Venditti.

“For anybody who had children, women who had been working became default caregivers, really with no choice, because women make less money.”

Venditti also said that choice to decide on having kids was also compounded by the huge financial pressures associated with having them, and that many women who were making that decision witnessed what was happening to mothers in the workforce during the pandemic.

Several studies, reports and surveys pointed to women and especially working mothers as having had the short end of stick when it came to their careers and workforce futures during the pandemic.

 

A survey conducted in September 2020 found that one-third of working mothers in Canada had thoughts about quitting their jobs while a study in January 2021 from McKinsey & Company found that mothers were more than twice as likely as fathers to worry about their performance being judged negatively due to caregiving responsibilities.

A previous report from Statistics Canada which looked into gender differences in employment a year into the COVID-19 pandemic found that “women tended to be more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than their male counterparts.”

“On average over the study period, women accounted for 53.7 per cent of the year-over-year employment losses,” read the study.

“At the onset of the pandemic, in March 2020, employment losses for women accounted for 62.5% of overall employment losses, possibly linked to the allocation of family responsibilities in households and the fact that the many people perceived restrictions as being temporary.”

 

While Statistics Canada pointed to the losses as being more balanced over the spring of that year, women still accounted for the majority of year-over-year employment loss with a peak in November at 59.6 per cent.

“It was like we were expected to be both full time caregivers and full time workers,” said Venditti.

“You know, between me and my partner because women are systemically penalized, it makes more sense to protect your partner’s job because he has a full time job with benefits and whatever. So for us, it wasn’t a choice.”

More non-hospital births

The Statistics Canada report also found that there were more births in non-hospital settings like the home last year compared to 2019 — likely due to mothers’ fears of entering a hospital in the first year of the pandemic.

The spike in non-hospital births in 2020 came after a gradual decline over the previous five years, which itself followed a steady uptick between 2005 and 2015.

While the 7,606 births outside hospitals last year did not match the record-high rate of over 8,000 in 2015, the proportion of all births in Canada — 2.1 per cent — was the highest in a decade.

Midwives have suggested this could be a continuing trend. In a survey of its members last November, the Midwives Association of B.C. found 89 per cent of those responding reported more women asking about the home birth option between March and November compared with inquiries made before that period.

Almost 40 per cent described the increased interest in home births as moderate or large.

Murphy said no matter how women chose to have children last year, the pressures surrounding that choice were likely higher than in previous generations.

She added that’s why governments are increasingly focusing their messaging on family-oriented policies like inexpensive child care and child tax credits to help convince more people to start a family.

 

“You had people losing their jobs, this increase in the cost of housing,” she said. “Those who did have kids had to stay home and be daycare as well as teachers.

“So you could understand why a rational woman or a couple might just say, we don’t think so.”

Jim Gomez And Joeal Calupitan,The Associated Press,11/28/2017,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday announced he was retiring from politics and dropping plans to run for vice president in next year’s elections when his term ends, avoiding a legal battle with opponents who question such a move.

Speaking before reporters, Duterte said many Filipinos have expressed their opposition to his vice-presidential bid in surveys and public forums.

“The overwhelming sentiment of the Filipino is that I’m not qualified, and it would be a violation of the constitution,” Duterte said. “In obedience to the will of the people … I will follow what you wish and today I announce my retirement from politics.”

The 76-year-old leader, known for his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, brash rhetoric and unorthodox political style, earlier accepted the ruling party’s nomination for him to seek the vice presidency in the May 9 elections. The decision outraged many of his opponents, who have described him as a human rights calamity in an Asian bastion of democracy.

Duterte announced his surprise withdrawal from the election after accompanying his former longtime aide, Sen. Bong Go, to register his own vice presidential candidacy with the ruling party at a Commission on Elections center.

Philippine presidents are limited by the constitution to a single six-year term and opponents had said they would question the legality of Duterte’s announced vice presidential run before the Supreme Court if he pursues his bid.

While two past presidents have run for lower elected positions after their terms ended in recent history, Duterte was the first to consider running for the vice presidency. If he pursued the candidacy and won, that could elevate him back to the presidency if the elected leader dies or is incapacitated for any reason.

Duterte’s withdrawal could also pave the way for the possible presidential run of his politician daughter

Sara Duterte currently serves as mayor of southern Davao city, and has been prodded by many supporters to make a bid to succeed her father. She has topped independent public opinion surveys on who should lead the country next.

But after her father initially declared that he would seek the vice presidency, Sara Duterte announced she would not run for president, saying she and her father have agreed that only one Duterte would run for a national office next year.

There was no immediate reaction from the president’s daughter, who has gone on a weeklong medical leave.

Duterte took office in 2016 and immediately launched a crackdown on illegal drugs that has left more than 6,000 mostly petty suspects dead and alarmed Western governments and human rights groups. The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of the killings but he has vowed never to cooperate with the inquiry and allow ICC investigators to enter the country."
